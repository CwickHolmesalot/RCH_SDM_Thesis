\chapter{Geothermal Exploration\\Machine Learning Results}\label{ch5:ml_results}
Chapter \ref{ch3:expl_ml_prep} outlined the machine learning and uncertainty analysis strategy for characterizing geothermal gradient, a proxy for the heat risk element, across the Southwestern NM study area. This chapter reviews the results of applying that strategy with the curated data set described in Appendix \ref{app:A_data_layers}. In addition, this chapter places insights from the model results and uncertainty evaluation in context with mitigating risks associated with geothermal exploration.

The logistic regression (LR) model used in this analysis \citep{pedregosa_scikit-learn_2011} includes a single tunable hyperparameter, \verb|C|. Rather than rely on the pre-split training and validation subsets defined in Section \ref{ch3:strat_sample} to tune this hyperparameter, the subsets were re-combined and stratified-sampled as part of a 10-fold CV process. ROC AUC OvR was used as the scoring metric. Results vary for the different input data sets; CV results for WDS show a clear maximum AUC marking the optimal value for \verb|C|, whereas CV for WDS4 and WDS8 demonstrate a leveling-off trend and the optimal value must be selected near the elbow (Figure \ref{fig:logreg_hp_tuning}). The chosen \verb|C| values for WDS, WDS4, and WDS8 are listed in Table \ref{tab:logreg_tuning}.

\end{figure}

Out-of-sample AUC values calculated on the testing subset indicate WDS4 has the best performance of the three data sets. Figure \ref{fig:logreg_coefs} shows a plot of the feature coefficients for each of the class-specific OvR classifiers in the WDS4 model. Longer bars indicate larger influence on the model prediction. The top 5 features across the four classifiers are Si Geothermometer Temperature, Basement Depth, Drainage Density, Spring Density, and Volcanic Dike Density.

\subsection{Feature Selection} \label{ch5:lr_feature_selection}
Figure \ref{fig:logreg_rfe} presents the results of Recursive Feature Selection (RFE, see Section \ref{ch3:lr_rfe}) applied to the LR model for WDS4. Based on the plot, a local peak in AUC occurs when 18 features are used. Adding the remaining features results in small gains in AUC, but with diminishing returns for six additional features of complexity. Using this threshold, the data layers removed from the model include: DEM Gradient, Gravity Gradient, Magnetic Anomaly, Magnetic Anomaly Gradient, Water Table Depth, and Average Precipitation. Note that Average Precipitation appears higher on the coefficients plot (Figure \ref{fig:logreg_coefs}) than other features that were not removed. Since RFE iteratively removes predictors and refits the model, relative coefficients can change, particularly if there was collinearity with a removed variable.

\caption[Logistic regression confusion matrix]{Confusion matrix for the tuned LR model trained on WDS4.}
\label{fig:logreg_conf_matrix}
\end{figure}
A final LR model trained on WDS4 was constructed using the tuned \verb|C| hyperparameter and reduced feature set from RFE. The confusion matrix shows moderately good model performance (Figure \ref{fig:logreg_conf_matrix}). Correct predictions for each of the four classes of geothermal gradient (TP) outnumber the misclassifications for those classes (FP). The model appears to struggle most with differentiating between class 2 and class 3 locations, which separate mid-grade (40--60 K/km) from high-grade gradients (>60 K/km), although there are a large number of misclassifications (26) of low-grade gradient as high-grade as well.

Figure \ref{fig:logreg_auc} plots the macro average, micro average, and individual class ROC curves. Class 0 (non-thermal) predictive ability is quite high, pulling the micro-average AUC up to 0.88.  The macro AUC value of 0.85 is more aligned with the performance for other classes, which range from an AUC of 0.79--0.83. The trade-off between Class 2 and Class 3 is apparent in how the curve shapes mirror each other.

\end{figure}

Model predictions for the study area are generated by passing the FDS through the final trained model. Class predictions are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:logreg_final_map}. High-grade geothermal gradient patches are concentrated to the southeast and through the center of the AOI. Smaller high-grade regions are observed along the southwest state boundary, following the Rio Grande River to the northeast, and a smaller patch directly to the north.  Comparing this result to the Southwestern NM PFA geothermal gradient data layer from \citet{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015}, high-grade predictions match in general spatial location except for the predicted patches to the north. The LR model tends to predict more widespread and spatially-continuous high-grade regions, while under-predicting lower gradient regions to the north (Colorado Plateau), east (Great Plains), and mid-AOI near the Rio Grande River compared to the PFA layer.

\section{Decision Trees}\label{ch5:dtree_model}
\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}\label{ch5:dtree_tuning}
Stepping up in complexity, the scikit-learn version of the decision tree (DT) classifier has over ten adjustable hyperparameters for tuning performance \citep{pedregosa_scikit-learn_2011}. Here, six hyperparameters are tuned using the stratified k-Fold CV method described in Section \ref{ch3:strat_kfold_cv}, with 10 folds and the multi-class OvR ROC AUC as the scoring metric. The tuning process relied on defaults for the scikit-learn \textit{DecisionTreeClassifier} to define initial values until a specific hyperparameter was tuned. Figures below illustrate the tuning results for the WDS4 data set.

First, \verb|max_depth| and \verb|criterion| were tuned together. \verb|max_depth| limits tree expansion by capping the number of parameter evaluations (tree nodes) considered before a classification label assignment. \verb|criterion| refers to the quality metric used for tree construction, i.e. Gini index or Entropy. The similarity of AUC curves in Figure \ref{fig:dtree_maxdepth} illustrates a relative insensitivity to \verb|criterion|, while \verb|max_depth| plays a stronger role in classifier performance. A maximum AUC score is observed with a \verb|max_depth| of 8 and \verb|criterion| choice of Entropy.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-DT_tuning_maxdepth_criterion.png}
\caption[Decision tree max depth tuning]{Results from stratified k-fold cross validation tuning of the max\_depth and criterion hyperparameters using WDS4. The red dashed line indicates the selected max\_depth value.}
\label{fig:dtree_maxdepth}
\end{figure}

Next, \verb|min_samples_leaf| and \verb|min_samples_split| were tuned in succession. The former defines the minimum number of samples from the training set that must be assigned to a leaf node for that leaf to remain in the tree. The latter sets a minimum number of training set samples that must be assigned to a node before that node can be considered for a split. Figure \ref{fig:dtree_min_samples} illustrates the selected hyperparameter values, defined by maxima in the AUC vs. hyperparameter value plots. The insensitivity of the classifier to low values of \verb|min_samples_split| demonstrates the cascading influence of the hyperparameters in this tuning flow. When \verb|min_samples_leaf| is set to 8, a split can only occur when the node being split has at least 16 observations, so any \verb|min_samples_split| value under 16 does not influence tree construction. 

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-DT_tuning_min_samp_leaf_split.png}
\caption[Decision tree min samples tuning]{Results from stratified k-fold cross validation tuning of the min\_samples\_leaf (Left) and min\_samples\_split (Right) hyperparameters using WDS4. The red dashed lines indicate the selected values.}
\label{fig:dtree_min_samples}
\end{figure}

One optimization trick when training DT models is to only consider a subset of the features when splitting decision tree nodes. This also adds an element of randomness to tree construction, so decision trees can differ when constructed on the same training data depending on how many features were considered for each split. No clear maximum appears in the AUC plot for \verb|max_features| (Figure \ref{fig:dtree_max_features}), so a value of 8 was selected using the elbow criterion. \verb|max_features| can also cause problems when performing feature selection if the feature count drops below the \verb|max_features| value, so care must be taken in using this hyperparameter.

\begin{figure}[!htp]

\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-DT_tuning_max_features.png}

\label{fig:dtree_max_features}
\end{figure}

The final hyperparameter, \verb|ccp_alpha|, controls the trade-off between model fit and complexity during the tree-pruning backward pass of tree construction. As the alpha value increases from zero, the difference between in-sample (training) and out-of-sample (validation) performance decreases, but so does the overall performance of the classifier on the validation subset. Figure \ref{fig:dtree_alpha} shows a clear minimum in train-validate AUC difference, however the validation set performance drops from 0.95 to under 0.85 when using this value for \verb|ccp_alpha|. The default value of \verb|ccp_alpha| = 0.0 is chosen instead to maximize out-of-sample AUC.

\label{fig:dtree_alpha}
\end{figure}

Final hyperparameter values and performance results for WDS, WDS4, and WDS8 are listed in Table \ref{tab:dtree_tuning}. The data augmentation strategy behind WDS4 and WDS8 results in a significant improvement in classifier performance over the original WDS.

\subsection{Feature Selection}\label{ch5:dtree_feat_selection}
Figure \ref{fig:dtree_feat_import} shows the feature importances determined by models constructed using WDS, WDS4, and WDS8. Features are sorted on the sum of importance values across all 3 data sets. Although differences exist, Si Geothermometer Temperature tops the list as the most important predictor in all cases. And the bottom six features are also remarkably consistent across data sets: Water Table Depth, Water Table Gradient, Gravity Anomaly Gradient, Magnetic Anomaly, Magnetic Anomaly Gradient, and DEM Gradient. Dropping these features reduces the count to 18 features in total.

\subsection{Optimized Model Results}\label{dtree_final_results}

\caption[Decision tree confusion matrix]{Confusion matrix for tuned DT model trained on WDS4.}
\label{fig:dtree_conf_matrix}
\end{figure}

A final DT model trained on WDS4 was constructed using the tuned hyperparameters and 18-predictor reduced feature set. The confusion matrix (Figure \ref{fig:dtree_conf_matrix}) demonstrates an improvement in model results over the logistic regression method. Low-grade gradient locations are correctly predicted for almost double the number of sites, and half as many misclassifications are observed between class 2 (mid-grade) and class 3 (high-grade) geothermal gradient than with the LR model.

Figure \ref{fig:dtree_auc} shows the macro average, micro average, and individual class DT ROC curves. All individual class AUC values exceed 0.90. Class 0 (non-thermal) continues to demonstrate the highest predictive performance (AUC=0.97), but class 3 (high-grade) predictive ability boosts micro-average AUC at higher decision thresholds, i.e., where the class 0 ROC curve steeply drops in TPR for FPR < 0.1. Class 2 (medium-grade) classification performance lags behind all other classes for the DT classifier.

\caption[Decision tree ROC curves]{ROC curves for the tuned DT model trained on WDS4.}
\label{fig:dtree_auc}
\end{figure}

Model predictions for the study area are generated by passing the FDS through the DT model. Class assignments are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:dtree_final_map}. The high-grade geothermal gradient patches to the southeast and central regions of the AOI are not as broad and continuous as in the LR model (Figure \ref{fig:logreg_final_map}). Predictions for low-grade gradient or non-thermal areas are concentrated to the NW (Colorado Plateau) and central-east (Rio Grade Rift-Great Plains transition). The overall distribution of geothermal gradient classes is similar to the \citet{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} PFA layer (Figure \ref{fig:dtree_final_map}) but with a greater apportionment of high-grade gradient areas and fewer low-grade or non-thermal locations in the DT model.

\label{fig:dtree_final_map}
\end{figure}

Note that if the random seed (fixed in this study for solution repeatability) is free to change and new DT models are constructed, some of the characteristics of this DT prediction will also change. In fact, one downside of the DT model is this randomness; decision trees will structurally rearrange each time the algorithm is run, even on the same training data, due to randomness in the node splitting process. Nevertheless, tree performance remains relatively stable overall. And the ability to plot and visually step through the model makes it one of the most accessible and interpretable methods to use (See Figure \ref{fig:dtree_viz}).

\section{Tree Ensembles (XGBoost)}\label{ch5:xgb_model}
\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}\label{ch5:xgb_tuning}
XGBoost comes with many of the same hyperparameters as decision trees, plus additional parameters related to boosting and optimization. With so many hyperparameters, tuning the model becomes a time-consuming and complex process. The method followed here was adapted from an online tutorial covering the topic \citep{jain_xgboost_2016}.
\\
\\
The following hyperparameters were tuned for the final model:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Maximum depth}: similar to \verb|max_depth| for decision trees, restricts how deep each tree can grow during construction. Initially set to 5.
    \item \textbf{Minimum child weight}: sets a minimum weight requirement for a leaf nodes during the backward pass pruning process. Similar to \verb|min_samples_leaf| in decision trees, except this uses the XGBoost-specific weights noted in equation \ref{eq:xgb_objective}. Initially set to 1.0.
    \item \textbf{Gamma}: defines a minimum reduction in the loss function necessary for a split to be preserved during tree pruning. Initially set to 0.2.
    \item \textbf{Learning rate}: also known as the shrinkage factor, scales the impact of each tree on the boosted model prediction, i.e., the $\alpha$ in equation \ref{eq:xgb_form}. Initially set to 0.01.
    \item \textbf{Lambda}: L2 regularization term on the leaf scores, i.e., the $\lambda$ in equations \ref{eq:xgb_objective} and \ref{eq:xgb_obj_simple}. Initially set to 1.0.
    \item \textbf{Subsample}: defines the fraction of observations in the full training set that are randomly selected as a limited training set for each tree. Initially set to 1.0.
    \item \textbf{Column sample by tree}: sets the fraction of predictors in the full training set that are randomly selected as a limited feature set for constructing each tree. Initially set to 1.0.
    \item \textbf{Number of estimators}: controls the number of sequential trees in the model, i.e., B in equation \ref{eq:xgb_form}. Initially set to 200.
    \item \textbf{Scale positive weight}: scales the gradient for the positive class to influence model corrections during training, useful for imbalanced classification. Initially set to 1.0.
\end{itemize}

The preferred tuning method for XGBoost is the cross-validation strategy described in Section \ref{ch3:strat_kfold_cv}. Since this method uses the input data to both train and validate, the pre-generated training and validation subsets (Table \ref{tab:stratified_split_counts}) were re-combined before using CV. An initial trial-and-error testing of different hyperparameter combinations found the best starting values for \verb|learning_rate| and \verb|n_estimators| were 0.01 and 200, respectively. Higher learning rates like those suggested by \citet{jain_xgboost_2016} led to a nearly perfect-fitting model before hyperparameters could be tuned, and more estimators created undesirably long training times. In the figures and discussion that follow, results are described for WDS4. Full results for all three data sets are provided in Table \ref{tab:xgb_tuning}.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-XGB_Hyperparameters.png}
\caption[XGBoost hyperparameter tuning]{Hyperparameter tuning results for XGBoost modeling. A. max\_depth, B. min\_child\_weight, C. gamma, D. subsample, E. colsample\_bytree, F. lambda. Red dashed lines indicate values selected for the final model.}
\label{fig:xgb_hyperparam}
\end{figure}

XGBoost hyperparameters were tuned in succession using 10-fold stratified CV and a grid search across potential hyperparameter values. Figure \ref{fig:xgb_hyperparam}A shows the results for \verb|max_depth|. As noted when tuning the DT model (Section \ref{ch5:dtree_tuning}), \verb|max_depth| does not exhibit a clear maximum in the AUC vs. hyperparameter value plot. A preferred value of 6 was instead selected using the elbow criterion.

Next, tuning was performed on the \verb|min_child_weight| hyperparameter. Results of the 10-fold stratified CV method revealed a clear maximum AUC when \verb|min_child_weight| is 2 (Figure \ref{fig:xgb_hyperparam}B).

XGBoost uses a default value of 0 for the \verb|gamma| hyperparameter, which controls when tree partitioning should stop based on loss reduction. Cross-validation shows nearly level AUC values out to \verb|gamma| = $3.8\times10^{-3}$, after which the AUC score quickly drops. This threshold value was selected for the model (Figure \ref{fig:xgb_hyperparam}C).

Trees in the XGBoost model can be trained on random subsets of training data observations and individual feature columns. Tuning of \verb|subsample| identified a broad maximum in AUC when using 60-80\% of the training observations to build decision trees (Figure \ref{fig:xgb_hyperparam}D). The selected \verb|subsample| value is 70\%. For \verb|colsample_bytree|, the best AUC results occur when 60\% of the features are included in the training (Figure \ref{fig:xgb_hyperparam}E). A value below 100\% for \verb|colsample_bytree| suggests removing features based on estimates of feature importance could be beneficial, as previously discussed for both logistic regression (Section \ref{ch5:lr_feature_selection}) and decision trees (Section \ref{ch5:dtree_feat_selection}). A more robust method for feature attribution and selection using Shapley values is considered in Section \ref{ch5:xgb_feature_selection}.

Tuning results show model AUC remains flat, then quickly drops for increasing values of the \verb|lambda| hyperparameter (Figure \ref{fig:xgb_hyperparam}E). This behavior shows how higher levels of regularization can cause data underfitting. The largest \verb|lambda| value just short of this drop-off was selected for the final model.

\verb|scale_pos_weight| was similarly tuned, but AUC results remained unchanged for all hyperparameter values tested. The multi-class XGBoost classifier appears to be insensitive to this hyperparameter.

As a final step in model tuning, \verb|learning_rate| was decreased to 0.005 and \verb|n_estimators| increased to 1000.  Using the slower learning rate reduces the chance of overfitting the training data, while the increased number of sequential trees in the model ensures a good fit can be learned. 
Final hyperparameter values and performance results for WDS, WDS4, and WDS8 are listed in Table \ref{tab:xgb_tuning}. Once again, WDS4 and WDS8 out-perform the original WDS based on AUC values for the test set.

Section \ref{ch3:xgb_shapley} noted several desirable attributes of feature importances derived from Shapley analysis. Figure \ref{fig:xgb_shap_global} shows the SHAP values calculated for the XGBoost classifier. The plotted values are the average absolute value of SHAP based on the testing data subset of WDS4, and colors mark the individual value distributions for the four geothermal gradient classes. The top five most important features include Si Geothermometer Temperature, Heat Flow, Crustal Thickness, Volcanic Dike Density, and Spring Density.  Features not shown in the plot were deemed to have zero predictive value (i.e., DEM Gradient, Gravity Gradient, Magnetic Anomaly Gradient, and Water Table Depth). The lowermost four features on the plot --- Gamma Ray Absorbed Dose Rate, Magnetic Anomaly, Average Precipitation, and Water Table Gradient --- are also selected for elimination, reducing the final feature set for the XGBoost model to sixteen predictors.

\subsection{Optimized Model Results}\label{ch5:xgb_final_results}
A final XGBoost model parameterized with the tuned hyperparameter values (Table \ref{tab:xgb_tuning}) was trained on the reduced sixteen-feature version of WDS4. The resulting confusion matrix (Figure \ref{fig:xgb_conf_matrix}) demonstrates why XGBoost receives best-in-class praise as a predictive model. Test set accuracy for WDS4 is 94\%. The largest number of misclassifications (12) occur between high-grade (class 3) and medium-grade (class 2) geothermal gradient. And ten additional inaccurate labels classify low-grade (class 1) locations as medium-grade or vice-versa. Only two test set locations were off by more than one consecutive class.

Figure \ref{fig:xgb_auc} shows the macro average, micro average, and individual class XGBoost ROC curves. All individual class AUC values are at or above 0.99. This is close to an ideal ROC plot for a classifier.

Geothermal gradient predictions for the study area are generated by passing the FDS through the XGBoost model, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:xgb_final_map}. High-grade gradient areas to the southeast and central regions of the AOI align with the class 3 locations in the \citet{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} Southwestern NM PFA map. The XGBoost model predicts more spatially continuous and connected high-grade regions, with a limited number of isolated patches to the southwest and on the northern section of the Rio Grande River. Both maps have a similar non-thermal class 0 region to the north (Colorado Plateau), but they differ most significantly midway along the Rio Grande, to the south (Basin and Range), and in the eastern panhandle (Great Plains) where the PFA map predicts low-grade gradient or non-thermal classifications.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}
This thesis uses a TensorFlow-constructed neural network to test geothermal gradient classification performance for the Southwestern NM study area \citep{abadi_tensorflow_2016}. The network design is a 4-layer structure starting with an input layer of size (1x24), followed by two hidden layers sized (1x24), and ending in a four-class output layer (1x4) (Figures \ref{fig:nn_text_structure}, \ref{fig:nn_dot_structure}). Layer sizes assume all original features (except Average Air Temperature - see Section \ref{ch3:feat_corr}) are included in the training. In addition, the network applies dropout after each of the hidden layers. Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly assigning inputs to zero, temporarily severing a defined percentage of node connections during each step of the training process.

Since the number of weights being learned scales with the layer count and size of each layer, the choice of network architecture is a tunable parameter. The simplicity of this \acrlong{fcn} (\acrshort{fcn}) design keeps the architecture easily explainable while still enabling the network to learn complex non-linear relationships for geothermal gradient prediction.

Likewise, the choice of activation functions for each layer may also impact the performance of the network. ReLU functions overcome several limitations seen with more traditional activation choices like the sigmoid function, e.g., limited sensitivity and vanishing gradients, making ReLU the present-day standard for neural networks \citep{brownlee_gentle_2019}. Both hidden layers in the network described here apply ReLU activation functions.

The Adam optimization method was chosen for training the network due to its computational efficiency and current status as the recommended general-purpose optimizer \citep{brownlee_gentle_2017}. A description of Adam is beyond the scope of this thesis, but more information is widely available elsewhere \citep[e.g.,\ ][]{kingma_adam_2017}.

The training process updates network weights using gradients calculated from the entire training data in each training epoch \citep[p.\ 397]{hastie_elements_2009}. Successive epochs adjust the ANN to match the training data even more, so evaluating loss, AUC, or other metrics on both the training and validation sets is important for identifying the best number of epochs to avoid overfitting. Training can also proceed with mini-batches, that is, small subsets of the training set, rather than the whole set at once. This method makes the training results noisier, but generally speeds up learning while adding a regularization effect to changes in the weights \citep{brownlee_how_2019}.  

\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}\label{ch5:ann_tuning}
Tuning of the network focuses on five key hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item \textbf{Learning rate}: controls the magnitude of adjustments to the network weights during each step of the training process. The Adam optimizer adjusts this rate during training, so the value here defines a starting learning rate. Initially set to 0.001.
    \item \textbf{Lambda ($\lambda$)}: the L2 weight regularization term, i.e., the $\lambda$ in equation \ref{eq:nn_cost_function}. Initially set to $1\times10^{-4}$.
    \item \textbf{Batch size}: the number of training samples included in each mini-batch when calculating training gradients for updating the network weights. Initially set to number of samples/10.
    \item \textbf{Dropout rate}: the fraction of network connections zeroed-out during each step of the training process. Initially set to 0.2.
    \item \textbf{Number of epochs}: the number of training repetitions when fitting the model to the data. Initially set to 100.
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}[htp]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-NN_Hyperparameters.png}

Red dashed lines mark the selected values for the final model.}
\label{fig:nn_tuning_plots}
\end{figure}

The stratified k-fold CV strategy described in Section \ref{ch3:strat_kfold_cv} was used for tuning ANN hyperparameters. Training continued for 100 epochs, and since TensorFlow models easily track metric values for both the training and validation sets at each epoch, the two sets were kept separate during the 10-fold CV process. In the figures and discussion that follow, results are described for WDS4. Full results for all three data sets are provided in Table \ref{tab:nn_tuning}.

\label{fig:nn_loss_plot}
\end{figure}

Tuning was conducted in the same order as listed in Figure \ref{fig:nn_tuning_plots}. Distinct maxima in CV-averaged AUC are observed for each hyperparameter. The selected values for the final WDS4 model include: \verb|learning_rate| of 0.01, \verb|lambda| value of $2\times10^{-4}$, \verb|batch_size| of 100, and \verb|dropout_rate| of 0.1. Minima in the average loss curves align with the selected hyperparameter values for all except \verb|lambda|, the regularization parameter on model weights. This matches the expected behavior described in Equation \ref{eq:nn_cost_function}, where \verb|lambda| controls the balance between loss and sum of squared weights in the cost function. As Figure \ref{fig:nn_tuning_plots}B shows, the loss term decreases as \verb|lambda| approaches zero.

Figure \ref{fig:nn_loss_plot} illustrates the WDS4 training progress as a time series of loss and AUC. The variance in both plots reflects noise introduced by mini-batch training, but convergence takes place quickly. The growing separation between the training and validation loss at greater epoch counts indicates the model is overfitting the training data. The cross-over of the training and validation lines, which corresponds with the tuned value for the \verb|epoch| hyperparameter, occurs somewhere close to 100 epochs for WDS4.

\subsection{Optimized Model Results}\label{ch5:nn_final_results}
The ANN model was re-trained for each of the three data sets using the hyperparameter values listed in Table \ref{tab:nn_tuning}. Data sparsity is problematic for the WDS model; even after careful tuning, the out-of-sample accuracy does not exceed 75\%, and test set AUC is just $\approx86\%$. Augmentation of the original data makes a big difference in ANN model performance. Models trained on both WDS4 and WDS8 demonstrate $\approx95\%$ accuracy and AUC values $>99\%$ (Table \ref{tab:nn_tuning}).

\label{fig:nn_confusion_matrix}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:nn_confusion_matrix} depicts the confusion matrix constructed from WDS4 model results. Similar to XGBoost model performance, nearly all of the misclassifications are off by only a single sequential class assignment, the most prevalent being between medium-grade (class 2) and high-grade (class 3) geothermal gradient. Overall, these are very strong results for a predictive classifier.

Figure \ref{fig:nn_auc} shows the macro average, micro average, and individual class ANN ROC curves. All individual class AUC values are at or above 0.99, as was the case for the XGBoost model. This is close to an ideal ROC plot for a classifier.

\end{figure}

The FDS was passed through the final ANN model to generate predictions for the study area as shown in Figure \ref{fig:nn_final_map}. Class 3 high-grade geothermal gradient regions to the southeast in the \citet{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} PFA layer are well-captured by the ANN model. The class 3 swath though the center of the AOI describes a broader, more continuous region of gradient potential than suggested by the PFA map. Additional high-gradient patches unique to the ANN map appear along the study area edges – in the southwest corner (Basin and Range), eastern panhandle (Great Plains), and to the northeast paralleling the Rio Grande river. The low-gradient zone to the north (Colorado Plateau) matches between the two maps, but most other class 0 areas in the \citeauthor{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} map are not observed in the ANN map. Interestingly, there appears to be greater overall similarity between the ANN map in Figure \ref{fig:nn_final_map} and the XGBoost map in Figure \ref{fig:xgb_final_map} than with the PFA map.

\section{Uncertainty Analysis}\label{ch5:uncertainty_analysis}
\subsection{Structural Uncertainty}\label{ch5:structural_uncertainty}
Figure \ref{fig:combined_maps} shows all four machine learning model predictions for the SW NM study area. The models differ in how individual areas are classified as well as overall character of the predictions, suggesting each model has a signature predictive style.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-All_Models.png}
\caption[Combined machine learning results]{Machine learning results for WDS4 using A. logistic regression, B. a decision tree, C. XGBoost, and D. an artificial neural network.

\label{fig:combined_maps}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:avg_final_map}A illustrates an ensemble average map, where each location is assigned the class with the maximum average probability across the four model predictions. Aspects of all four models in Figure \ref{fig:combined_maps} can be identified in this result, but the overall effect is a simpler model with a more spatially-conservative high-grade class 3 predictions. Also missing are many of the spurious high-gradient patches along the AOI boundaries and within the eastern panhandle or southern boot-heel. The \citeauthor{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} gradient feature map (Figure \ref{fig:avg_final_map}B) shows much more structure in geothermal gradient predictions by comparison, with a pock-marked appearance typical of interpolation bulls-eye patterns.

\label{fig:avg_final_map}
\end{figure}

Shannon entropy is calculated on this same averaged model using the underlying class probabilities. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:structural_entropy_map}. Normalized entropy values vary from 0 to 1, with high entropy defining locations where there is no clear differentiation between gradient class label probabilities. Regions colored red thus identify locations that are difficult for any model to classify based on inconclusive feature inputs, or alternatively, locations where the predicted class probabilities from the different models varied enough that, upon averaging, they converged to similar values and could not be disentangled.

Figure \ref{fig:avg_gradient_masked_map} illustrates an alternative way of presenting these results. Regions of high entropy (over 0.7) are masked in dark gray because of the uncertainty in their classifications. All other points have a color transparency that scales with entropy. Low uncertainty/entropy areas are uncommon, focused primarily in the southwest and in small patches to the central west and central east areas. High uncertainties trace the boundaries between areas of consistent gradient classifications to the north and southeast. For example, in the Colorado Plateau province to the north, they form a ring around a non-thermal region (class 0). This highlights model inconsistencies on exactly where the class 0-class 1 boundary should appear based on trends in the input feature data.

\subsection{Parameter Uncertainty}\label{ch5:param_uncertainty}
The TensorFlow Probability package was used to transform the ANN from Section \ref{ch5:ann_model} into a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) for uncertainty estimation \citep{dillon_tensorflow_2017}. Given the sparsity of training data available and the multiplier effect that probabilistic layers have on the number of trainable parameters in a BNN, only the second hidden layer was converted to a TensorFlow \textit{DenseVariational} layer (Figures \ref{fig:bnn_text_structure} and \ref{fig:bnn_dot_structure}). Standard normal ($N(0,1)$) distributions were used as priors for the layer nodes. The same hyperparameter values used for ANN construction (Table \ref{tab:bnn_metrics}) were also applied to the BNN with one exception: the number of epochs was increased by a factor of 3-4. Figure \ref{fig:bnn_loss} shows the training loss and AUC curves for WDS4, which justify this larger number of epochs for training. Table \ref{tab:bnn_metrics} notes the accuracy and AUC scores for the BNNs calculated from a single predictive run on the respective test data subsets.

Running the BNN multiple times will produce a collection of different model solutions. Figure \ref{fig:bnn_class_pdfs} shows the range of class label probabilities after predicting the classification of three well records 100 times using a BNN trained on the WDS4 training subset. Here, the relationship between entropy values and the overlap in class label probabilities is apparent. A low entropy scenario (Figure \ref{fig:bnn_class_pdfs}A) has strong stand-out between the maximum-probability class label and others, while high entropy situations (Figure \ref{fig:bnn_class_pdfs}C) have less certainty on the class label assignment.

\end{figure}

After re-training the BNN on the full WDS4 data set, predictions for the entire AOI were generated 1000 times. Geothermal gradient class probabilities from these realizations were averaged by class for each point location, and the maximum probability class was selected as the predicted label. Entropy values calculated from the ensemble-averaged probabilities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:bnn_entropy_map}. Figure \ref{fig:bnn_masked_pred_map} combines the 1000-run average prediction map with parameter uncertainties using a layer mask and transparency. Concentrated areas of high entropy/uncertainty appear to the southeast to either side of the Rio Grande River, and to the north near the edge of the Colorado Plateau (Figure \ref{fig:bnn_masked_pred_map}). Overall, there appear to be fewer locations with high entropy in the parameter uncertainty assessment compared to the structural uncertainty analysis for the four model architectures (Figure \ref{fig:avg_gradient_masked_map}).

\subsection{Measurement Uncertainty}\label{ch5:measure_uncertainty}
In this Southwestern NM case study, the sources of data, types of data, and options for error estimation vary greatly. Several features were acquired as pre-gridded raster files without accompanying error assessments or access to the original source data (Table \ref{tab:features}), e.g., air temperature, precipitation, strain rate, and layers from the \citeauthor{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} OpenEI submission \citep{kelley_geothermal_2015}. Table \ref{tab:feature_std_error} shows the top ten features identified by Shapley analysis for the XGBoost model in Section \ref{ch5:xgb_feature_selection}. Among those variables, \acrlong{sigt} (\acrshort{sigt}), Heat Flow, and Boron Concentration have readily-available standard error estimates either from the original source or data preparation process. Crustal Thickness standard error is both unknown and difficult to ascertain; the feature grid comes from contours fit to 2-D seismic models \citep{keller_comparative_1991}, which are unavailable for further analysis and review. The remaining top ten features consist of point or line data converted to density layers using KDE. Standard errors could be estimated for these features by performing bootstrap or jackknife resampling, applying KDE on the derivative data sets, and calculating standard errors from that sample population \multicitep{james_introduction_2013, p.\ 187-190;mcintosh_jackknife_2016}.

\label{tab:feature_std_error}
\end{table}

Shapley results show SiGT values influence the XGBoost model predictions more than any other feature (Figure \ref{fig:xgb_shap_global}). Uncertainty in the values for this feature should therefore produce uncertainty in the classification results. To examine this relationship further, the SiGT values assigned to well locations in WDS4 were perturbed to create a range of statistically-similar derivative data sets. Variability in the classification results after training on these data sets highlights model sensitivity to uncertainties in the feature measurements.

Values range from 0 for low entropy, low uncertainty (blue) to 1 for high entropy, high uncertainty (red).}
\label{fig:mu_entropy_map}
\end{figure}

A SiGT standard error estimate map (Figure \ref{fig:mu_stderr_entropy}A) was derived using the ArcGIS \textit{Empirical Bayes Kriging} method as described in Section \ref{ch3:ebk}. All SiGT observations were included in the algorithm, so variability in coincident points due to repeated field measurements influences the estimate. Standard errors were sampled from this map at WDS4 well locations and used to construct a normal distribution ($N(0,\sigma)$) for each location. A total of 100 variants of WDS4 were created by applying perturbations to the WDS4 SiGT values sampled from these distributions.

Transparency increases from none at entropy values close to 0, to full for entropy values close to 1. The background raster has been removed to better visualize the transparency effect.}
\label{fig:mu_masked_pred_map}
\end{figure}

XGBoost models, parameterized as described for WDS4 in Table \ref{tab:xgb_tuning}, were trained on the perturbed data sets and used to predict geothermal classifications for the FDS covering the full AOI. After ensemble-averaging the class probabilities at each point, the maximum probability class was selected as the class assignment for the average geothermal gradient classification map. Shannon entropy values calculated from the average class probabilities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:mu_entropy_map}. Figure \ref{fig:mu_masked_pred_map} combines both maps using entropy values >0.7 as a layer mask and assigning increasing transparency with greater entropy for the remaining points.

WGS4 XGBoost measurement uncertainty entropy map. Black circles indicate well locations in WDS4 used for training the final XGBoost classifier. }
\label{fig:mu_stderr_entropy}
\end{figure}

Interestingly, variations in SiGT values result in high classification uncertainty in many locations across the AOI (Figure \ref{fig:mu_masked_pred_map}). Concentrated areas of uncertainty are observed in the east-southeast -- an area where silica samples were collected but not where many WDS4 well observations are located (Figure \ref{fig:mu_stderr_entropy}A-B). Similarly, large patches of higher entropy appear in the north and just west of the AOI center. Once again, these are under-sampled regions in WDS4 (Figure \ref{fig:mu_stderr_entropy}B). It appears that as training data values for SiGT change due to perturbations, thresholds for XGBoost decision trees shift enough to significantly impact the stability of model predictions away from wells. SiGT-related splits will appear near the root node of decision trees based on its dominance over other features for classification importance. Changes to the decision thresholds will thus have a strong cascading effect on the final classification choices for XGBoost models. The problem lies in both the magnitude of SiGT standard errors as well as the heterogeneous sampling of the study area by WDS4 well locations. The degree of uncertainty seen here would likely be reduced if WDS4 included more comprehensive coverage of the study area.

\section{Comparative Study Insights}\label{ch5:case_insights}
\subsection{Southwestern New Mexico PFA}\label{ch5:caase_nm_pfa}
In the Southwestern NM PFA project, \citet{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} focused on hydrogeologic windows, defined as areas where erosion, faulting, or volcanic intrusions breach regional sealing layers and allow heated groundwater to reach the surface. Fundamentally, their work targeted hydrothermal systems when assigning geothermal favorability scores, treating heat, fluid volume, and flow path/reservoir as the key risk elements. The last risk element combines particle tracking of geochemical signatures (lithium, boron) with fluid recharge-discharge pathways, effectively replacing permeability and seal risk elements with a model of the subsurface water cycle. Although interesting in its own right, the integrated nature of the PFA favorability map makes it a poor benchmark for the machine learning results here which focus on the heat risk element alone. Instead, the geothermal gradient feature map described in Figure \ref{app:dl_geothermal_gradient}, which \citet{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} derived from NGDS data paired with additional oil \& gas well measurements, serves as the best reference for comparison. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-PFA_Gradient_Labels.png}
\caption[SW New Mexico PFA prospective areas]
{Four prospective regions (dark red outlines) selected among several in the Southwestern NM PFA study \protect\citep{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015}, including the Gila region, Lightning Dock, Rincon, and Truth or Consequences. Filled red polygons map areas with high-grade geothermal gradients in the \citeauthor{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} feature map. Black dots mark locations of USGS Known Geothermal Areas with most-likely resource temperatures >60$^\circ$C. Labeled physiographic regions include Colorado Plateau (CP), Great Plains (GP), Mogollon-Datil Volcanic Field (MDVF), Rio Grande Rift (RGR), and Southern Basin and Range (SBR).}
\label{fig:pfa_prospects}
\end{figure}

The PFA study also honed in on specific locations in the study area due to perceived geothermal favorability. Figure \ref{fig:pfa_prospects} highlights four regions of interest combined with the SW NM physiographic province outlines and areas noted for high geothermal gradients (>60 K/km) in the \citeauthor{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} gradient feature map. To the southwest in the BR province lies Lightning Dock, the focus of the cost model case study in Chapters \ref{ch4:cm_prep} and \ref{ch6:cm_results} and a USGS-designated hydrothermal KGRA since 1974. To the south in the RGR province, the Rincon geothermal region is marked by high boron concentrations, high heat flow, and shallow geothermal gradients exceeding 300 K/km \citep{witcher_deep_2002}. North of Rincon is Truth or Consequences, an area locally known for low-temperature hot springs, high permeability, and elevated concentrations of both boron and lithium \citep{pepin_deep_2015}. Finally, a region near the Gila River within the MDVF province was flagged by \citet{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} as prospective based on known hot springs, high heat flow, and positive well geochemistry.

In Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}, the same prospect polygons are superimposed on the geothermal gradient solutions for the four supervised machine learning models. All models identify high-grade geothermal gradients in the Lightning Dock (LD) and Rincon (RC) areas. Interestingly, the decision tree model predicts a relatively lower gradient at the Radium Springs KGA (marker in RC polygon, Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}B) where high gradient values have been  directly measured. This serves as a good example of where individual models can deviate from a multi-model consensus. All models predict high gradients in the NW part of the Truth or Consequences (TC) polygon, but not at the marked TC spring (Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}). Gila (GL) also has mixed signals; the decision tree (Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}B) and neural network (Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}D) models suggest isolated patches of high gradient potential, but logistic regression (Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}A) and XGBoost (Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}C) make Gila look fairly unremarkable.

White markers plot KGAs related to the prospects with most-likely resource temperatures >60$^\circ$C.}
\label{fig:ml_models_prospects}
\end{figure}

The uncertainty analysis from Section \ref{ch5:uncertainty_analysis} reveals more on how to manage the four areas as exploration prospects. Figure \ref{fig:structural_uncertainty_prospects} quickly confirms some of the observations just outlined. There is low to moderate-low structural uncertainty (i.e., model agreement) for mid-grade gradients in GL and high-grade gradients at LD. High structural uncertainties appear in the TC and RC polygons. For TC, models disagree on the exact boundary between mid- and high-gradient zones. RC uncertainty is more pervasive, so additional modeling or model rationalization would be advised before executing expensive field operations (e.g., drilling) in that area.

\label{fig:param_uncertainty_prospects}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:param_uncertainty_prospects} illustrates parameter uncertainty based on repeated runs of the BNN model. Gradient predictions for LD, GL, and TC all share moderate to high certainty. However, low parameter certainty is observed throughout the RC polygon. The ANN model predicted high-grade geothermal gradients at RC, but also mid-grade, low-grade, and even non-thermal locations (Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}D). If RC was a target prospect, using predictions from the neural network to guide next steps would not be advised. Explorationists would do well to choose a simpler model with more parameter certainty if no additional data is available for further training the neural network.

White markers plot KGAs related to the prospects with most-likely resource temperatures >60$^\circ$C.}
\label{fig:measure_uncertainty_prospects}
\end{figure}

Measurement uncertainty depicted in Figure \ref{fig:measure_uncertainty_prospects} considers Si Geothermometer Temperature (SiGT) in isolation from the rest of the input feature set, noting that SiGT dominates in feature importance for the XGBoost model (see Section \ref{ch5:xgb_feature_selection}). The level of measurement certainty for all four prospective areas is striking. A strip of low certainty appears at the gradient class boundary at TC, and likewise to the NW for Rincon. However, these results indicate no strong need to supplement or replace the SiGT data for the prospect areas, as might be the case for other locations within the AOI.
\\
In summary, the uncertainty analysis shows:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
    \item All models agree LD has the best high-grade gradient potential, while GL and TC are less prospective. The models are collectively inconclusive on RC.
    \item Neural network parameter uncertainty makes it an unreliable model for assessing the RC area.
    \item SiGT measurements are relatively certain for the prospect areas. Additional expenditures for SiGT data may not be necessary.
\end{itemize}
Treating this analysis as part of a hypothetical exploration program, the overall heat element favorability and low uncertainty would make LD a good prospect to progress to the well-planning stage. High uncertainty at RC would need to be addressed through additional pre-screening efforts before committing the resources and capital to drilling there.

\subsection{Southwestern New Mexico PCA}\label{ch5:case_nm_pca}
In a more recent study, \citet{pepin_new_2019} applied unsupervised PCA with k-means clustering to assess the geothermal potential of the Southwestern NM study area. \citeauthor{pepin_new_2019} noted the physiographic provinces in NM exert strong controls on the presence and type of USGS-identified KGRAs observed across the state. The cluster analysis identified two high-potential zones with different characteristics. The first defines a predominantly high-temperature hydrothermal zone stretching east-west from LD to the eastern AOI boundary and up along the Rio Grande to just above RC \citep[Figure 3.5A,][]{pepin_new_2019}. A second high-potential region surrounds the narrow zone where CP, MDVF, RGR, and GP provinces all converge \citep[Figure 3.5C,][]{pepin_new_2019}, although this second group largely comprises systems with low-temperature hot springs. 

The supervised learning results presented in Figures \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects} and \ref{fig:structural_uncertainty_prospects} clearly display a correlation between high-grade geothermal gradient and physiographic province, but the relationship differs from that described by \citet{pepin_new_2019}. Models consistently predict high-grade gradients in the southern RGR and eastern MDVF provinces, with an additional ``hot spot'' where the RGR narrows to the north. This pattern repeats for all four machine learning models, and is present, albeit less obvious, in the geothermal gradient feature map from \citet{bielicki_hydrogeolgic_2015} (see Figure \ref{fig:pfa_prospects}). \citet{pepin_new_2019} places the MDVF province in a low-potential cluster, driven in part to risk elements not considered here like structure/permeability. Nevertheless, the PCA model shows relatively strong overlap between clusters \citep[Figure 3.4,][]{pepin_new_2019}, suggesting additional data engineering or alternative dimensionality-reduction methods could be of value before fully-discounting the prospectivity of the MDVF province.

Cluster analysis shows great promise, particularly in identifying how the influence of different features changes across a study area. \citet{pepin_new_2019}, \citet{smith_characterizing_2021}, and \citet{vesselinov_discovering_2020} all illustrate this point with significantly different dominant predictors for clusters correlated to individual physiographic provinces. Similar variance in feature importances was observed in the Shapley analysis by class (Figure \ref{fig:xgb_shap_global}); e.g., Si Geothermometer Temperatures top the importance list for class 0 and 1, but come in 2nd to Volcanic Dikes for class 3, and 4th from last in importance for class 2.

Perhaps more interesting is the relationship between high-grade geothermal gradients and complex physiographic province \textit{junctions} (i.e., system interfaces) as seen in Figure \ref{fig:ml_models_prospects}. Specifically, the two boundary zones between 3 or 4 provinces within the AOI both have consistent high-grade geothermal gradient classifications. These zones also correspond with the two prospective clusters in the PCA analysis \citep{pepin_new_2019}. Whether greater geothermal potential at complex province junctions is unique to this study area or more broadly applicable requires further research.

\section{Recap}\label{ch5:recap}
This chapter presented the results from applying the four supervised machine learning models described in Chapter \ref{ch3:expl_ml_prep} to the curated data (Appendix \ref{app:A_data_layers}) for the Southwestern NM study area. Uncertainties associated with the choice of models, the model parameters, and data measurements were also examined in the context of next-steps decisions for an explorationist. The chapter concluded with a comparison with other geothermal prospectivity studies for the region.
\\
\\
Key insights from the work include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Logistic regression models are simple and easy to tune, however other model techniques have much stronger predictive performance.
    \item Decision trees are highly-explainable and directly identify feature importances. A notable downside is results can vary based on random structural variations during construction.
    \item XGBoost models demonstrate very strong predictive performance and support best-in-class Shapley feature attribution analysis. However, XGBoost model tuning can be complex and time-consuming.
    \item The highest degree of model complexity comes from neural network architectures, which show great performance if sufficient training data is available to constrain the enormous number of model parameters.
    \item Structural uncertainty analysis highlights areas where models collectively agree or diverge on predictions. This is useful for rationalizing model selection and identifying spatial areas that require further study before taking costly actions.
    \item Parameter uncertainties indicate the ``known unknowns'' for a model, i.e., locations where model predictions are poorly-constrained. Corrective actions include training on more data or relying on a different model technique.
    \item Measurement uncertainties characterize the impact of data reliability on model predictions. If high uncertainty exists in an area of interest, additional data acquisition may be needed, especially from sources with lower standard errors. 
    \item The value of this approach to exploration risk mitigation is demonstrated for  prospective areas identified in the Southwestern NM PFA study. High favorability, low uncertainty prospects (e.g., Lightning Dock) could progress to a well-planning stage, but areas with mixed favorability and low uncertainty (e.g., Rincon) would require additional pre-screening first.
    \item A correlation between physiographic provinces and geothermal favorability established in other studies is also observed in the Southwestern NM study area. In addition, high-grade geothermal gradients (positive heat risk element values) align with complex convergence zones between 3 or more physiographic provinces.
\end{enumerate}

%\label{fig:model_flow}
%\end{wrapfigure}

%Supervised learning methods for classification come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Rather than settle on one for predicting geothermal gradient, four different methods are applied to the southwestern NM data set. Figure \ref{fig:model_flow} illustrates the high-level modeling flow, where model complexity increases with successive steps. The method descriptions below only briefly delve into important model mechanics and key hyperparameters (i.e., parameters not learned from data) that impact model performance. Other sources can provide a deeper review of machine learning algorithms and their mathematical underpinnings. This investigation should instead be considered an applied case study that uses these algorithms as tools for generating insights on geothermal potential.

%\subsection{Assessing Performance}\label{ch5:modeling_assessments}
%Building an intuition for the differences in predictive ability of different models first requires a clear definition of the scoring metric(s) used to compare those models. The characterization of classifier performance typically begins with a confusion matrix. In its simplest form, the confusion matrix evaluates class predictions as \acrlong{tp} (\acrshort{tp}; predicted 1, actually 1), \acrlong{tn} (\acrshort{tn}; predicted 0, actually 0), \acrlong{fp} (\acrshort{fp}; predicted 1, actually 0), and \acrlong{fn} (\acrshort{fn}; predicted 0, actually 1). For the multi-class problem, the confusion matrix expands to include all correct classification and misclassification options. Figure \ref{fig:confusion_matrix} illustrates the elements of a 4-class matrix.

%\begin{figure}[!htp]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-Confusion_Matrix.png}
%\caption[Four-class confusion matrix]{Confusion matrix diagram for a 4-class scenario. A. Each cell represents a pairing between an actual class label (rows) and the predicted label (columns). True positives for each class are down the diagonal. B. Example of matrix interpretation using class 2 as a point of reference. Elements associated with TP, FP, TN, and FN values are labeled.}
%\label{fig:confusion_matrix}
%\end{figure}

%Several statistical measures can be defined using combinations of elements in the confusion matrix. Of significance to this study are the \acrlong{tpr} (\acrshort{tpr}) and \acrlong{fpr} (\acrshort{fpr}) \citep{tharwat_classification_2020}:

%\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
%\item \textbf{True Positive Rate}: the count of correctly-predicted positives scaled by the actual positives: TP/(TP$+$FN).
%\item \textbf{False Positive Rate}: the count of incorrectly-predicted positives scaled by the actual negatives: FP/(FP$+$TN).
%\end{itemize}

%Classification relies on a probability threshold for assigning a class label. As the threshold lowers, the chances the classifier will believe it has a label match will increase. By varying this threshold, it becomes possible to map out the discriminating ability of a classifier by plotting a curve in TPR vs. FPR space (Figure \ref{fig:roc}). This is commonly referred to as the \acrlong{roc} (\acrshort{roc}) curve \citep{fawcett_introduction_2006}. A classifier that cannot discriminate between classes will perform no better than random guessing, resulting in a curve that plots along the diagonal from the origin to the upper right of the plot. On the other hand, a perfect classifier will have a TPR of 1.0 for all thresholds, so it plots straight up along the y-axis and then horizontally at TPR = 1.0. Typical ROC curves plot in the upper-left space between these two extremes.

%\begin{figure}[!htp]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-ROC_AUC_Diagram.png}
%\caption[Receiver Operating Characteristic diagram]{ROC curve diagram in TPR vs. FPR space. Perfect classifiers will plot along the ideal case line (green), poor classifiers plot along the diagonal (red). AUC (gray) characterizes the quality of the classifier on a scale of 0.5 to 1.0.}
%\label{fig:roc}
%\end{figure}

%Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) defines a summary statistic for the ROC function (see Figure \ref{fig:roc}) \citep{fawcett_introduction_2006}. Since the ideal classifier has a TPR of 1.0 at all times, the ideal AUC also equals 1.0. In the non-ideal case, the AUC drops to 0.5. AUC values and ROC curves provide a standardized means of comparing classifiers and are the primary performance metric used in this thesis.

%With multi-class classification, defining single class performance using the definitions of TP, FP, TN, and FN as shown in Figure \ref{fig:confusion_matrix}B is relatively straight-forward. Overall classifier performance across all classes can also be characterized with a single ROC curve using macro, weighted, or micro averaging \citep{scikit-learn_sklearnmetricsroc_auc_score_2021}.

%\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]
%    \item \textbf{Macro}: averaging matches the unweighted arithmetic mean of metric values.
%    \item \textbf{Weighted}: averaging follows the procedure of macro-averaging but adds a weight for each class contribution based on the fraction of total observations that fall within that class. 
%    \item \textbf{Micro}: averaging considers class results in aggregate, so statistics are calculated across the entire confusion matrix. TPR becomes the accuracy and FPR becomes the error rate.
%\end{itemize}

%For imbalanced data sets, micro will indicate better performance than macro due to the impact of the dominant class. Both micro and macro averages are included in the classification analysis in the following sections.

%\subsection{Logistic Regression} \label{ch5:logistic_regression}
%\subsubsection{Binary Formulation} \label{ch5:lr_math}
%The classic \acrlong{lr} (\acrshort{lr}) model is a binary classifier that predicts one of two labels based on the input data. Linear regression treats the problem as a linear combination of the input observations \citep[p.\ 369]{bertsimas_analytics_2016}:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:linreg_form}
%    \hat{y} = {\bf{w^Tx}} = w_0 + w_1 \cdot x_1 + w_2 \cdot x_2 + \ldots + w_n \cdot x_n 
%\end{equation}

%Where $x_i$ are the feature observations, $w_i$ are coefficients or weights for those features, and $\hat{y}$ is the weighted sum. Logistic regression adjusts the problem such that predictions define the probability of belonging to class 1. This is done by using a non-linear logistic response function: 

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:sigmoid}
%h_{\theta}(x) = \frac{1}{(1+e^{-\hat{y}})} = %\frac{1}{(1+e^{-W^TX})}
%\end{equation}

%Equation \ref{eq:sigmoid}, also known as the \textit{sigmoid} function, converts the weighted sum from equation \ref{eq:linreg_form} to values between 0 and 1 \citep[p.\ 369]{bertsimas_analytics_2016}. Solving for the weights in this equation ($w_i$) requires an iterative optimization procedure like gradient descent. This procedure minimizes a cost function ($J(\Theta)$) based on the negative log likelihood \citep{ng_logistic_2011}:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:logreg_cost}
%\begin{aligned}
%        J(\Theta) &= -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}{\text{Cost}(h_{\theta}(x_i),y_i)} \\ &= -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}{(y_i*\text{log}({h_{\theta}(x_i)})+(1-y_i)*\text{log}(1-h_{\theta}(x_i)))}
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}

%Regularization is added to logistic regression to avoid overfitting, specifically by penalizing the sum of the squared weights (L2-regularization). A constant ($\lambda$) determines the trade-off of influence between the magnitude of the weights and negative log likelihood in the minimization \citep{ng_regularization_2011}.

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:logreg_cost_reg}
%    regularized\,J(\Theta) = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}{\text{Cost}(h_{\theta}(x_i),y_i) + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}{w_j^2}}
%\end{equation}

%The scikit-learn \textit{LogisticRegression} function uses a constant C applied to the negative log likelihood term, which acts like the inverse of $\lambda$. Larger values of C result in less regularization \citep{scikit-learn_1111_2021}.

%\subsubsection{Multi-Class Heuristics} \label{ch5:lr_multiclass}
%This formulation of logistic regression defines a strictly binary classification problem without multi-class support. Two heuristic methods allow LR to extend to multi-class classification: \acrlong{ovo} (\acrshort{ovo}) and \acrlong{ovr} (\acrshort{ovr}) \citep{brownlee_one-vs-rest_2020,scikit-learn_multiclass_2021}. Both split the problem into multiple binary classifications. OvO considers every class versus every other class. In the 4-class geothermal gradient problem, this amounts to six classifications: {(0 vs. 1), (0 vs. 2), (0 vs. 3), (1 vs. 2), (1 vs. 3), (2 vs. 3)}. OvR simplifies the problem by combining class alternatives so the number of classifiers matches the number of classes: {(0 vs. [1, 2, or 3]),(1 vs. [0, 2, or 3]), (2 vs. [0, 1, or 3]),(3 vs. [0, 1, or 2])}. For both methods, the class with the greatest score or sum of scores wins, where the score is akin to the probability of class membership. This thesis uses the OvR strategy.

%\subsubsection{Stratified k-Fold Cross-Validation} %\label{ch5:strat_kfold_cv}
%Brute force tuning of a hyperparameter can be accomplished by training a series of classifiers with different hyperparameter values and evaluating each classifier's predictive ability against the validation data subset. A more statistically stable approach involves k-Fold \acrlong{cv} (\acrshort{cv}). K-fold CV splits the input data into a number of subsets, or folds. It trains the model on the aggregate of all but one fold, then scores the classifier based on that remaining fold \citep[p. 181]{james_introduction_2013}. This leave-one-fold-out strategy cycles through all k permutations, and the scores are averaged to produce a summary statistic --- in this case, the AUC. For imbalanced class data, folds can be stratified sampled such that class proportions are preserved within each fold \citep{brownlee_how_2020}. For parameter tuning, the k-Fold CV will define a set of average scores for the range of hyperparameter values under consideration, and the optimal parameter value can be determined from a plot of those scores.

%\subsubsection{Feature Selection} \label{ch5:lr_rfe}
%By consequence of Equation \ref{eq:sigmoid}, logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the weighted sum of independent predictors and the log-odds, i.e., $\log(\frac{P(y=1)}{1-P(y=1)})$. However, including all possible predictors will not necessarily improve the model. Feature selection can lead to simpler models with the same predictive power but reduced risk of collinearity, which is important when managing data from naturally integrated earth systems. 

%One method for selecting the features to keep involves an iterative process called \acrlong{rfe} (\acrshort{rfe}) (Brownlee, 2020c; scikit-learn, 2021d). The concept is relatively simple: RFE recursively selects and removes the feature with the smallest coefficient in the logistic regression model, then refits the data and repeats until a user-defined number of features is reached.  A plot of AUC vs. number of features can be constructed by looping over different feature limits, where the logistic regression model is fit on the training subset and evaluated on the validation subset

%\subsection{Decision Trees}\label{ch5:decision_trees}
 
%A decision tree, sometimes known as a Classification and Regression Tree (CART), classifies observations using a cascading set of evaluations, each on individual predictor variables. There is no assumption of a linear response in the system. In fact, decision trees are uniquely suited to representing non-linear behavior in a highly-explainable way; once constructed, the decision tree describes a flowchart-like roadmap for each label assignment \citep[p. 373--375]{bertsimas_analytics_2016}. Not every predictor will necessarily appear in the decision tree --- only those found to be significant during tree construction. And the most significant variables tend to be associated with early decision splits, placing them higher in the tree \citep[p. 376]{bertsimas_analytics_2016}. Because of this, decision trees naturally provide insights into feature importance. 

%\subsubsection{Tree Construction}
%Decision trees are constructed by recursively performing binary splits on the training data set. Each split defines two new nodes in the tree, which correspondingly separates a group within the training data into subgroups. These subgroups represent child paths from the split node that terminate in two new terminal leaf nodes on the tree. The classification decision for each leaf will be the most commonly occurring class from the training data observations that are assigned to that leaf \citep[p. 311]{james_introduction_2013}.

%There are three metrics that can play a role in evaluating the discriminating quality of a particular decision node on the tree:

%\begin{itemize}[itemsep=2pt]\label{ch5:impurity}
%    \item \textbf{Classification error rate}: the proportion of training samples that do not match the dominant class associated with a leaf node \citep[p. 312]{james_introduction_2013}.
%    \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:error_rate}
%        E = 1 - \max_k(\hat{p}_{mk})
%    \end{equation}
%    where $m$ is the segment of the data associated with a node, $k$ is the class, and $\hat{p}_{mk}$ is the fraction of all training observations in $m$ that are of class $k$. 
%    \item \textbf{Gini index}: measures variance across all k classes. Gini is sometimes known as a purity measurement because low values correspond with a strongly dominant class \citep[p. 312]{james_introduction_2013}.
%    \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:gini}
%        G = \sum_{k=1}^{K}{\hat{p}_{mk}(1-\hat{p}_{mk})}
%    \end{equation}
%    \item \textbf{Entropy}: An alternative form of purity measure, which also shows low values when the proportion of one class dominates the others within a node \citep[p. 312]{james_introduction_2013}.
%    \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:entropy}
%        D = -\sum_{k=1}^{K}{\hat{p}_{mk}* \text{log}(\hat{p}_{mk})}
%    \end{equation}
%\end{itemize}

%The purity aspect of both Gini index and entropy make them good choices for tree construction. In the forward pass, the tree will iteratively grow by selecting nodes in the tree, a predictor to split on, and a threshold value defining the split. These choices are optimized by the chosen quality metric. The tree will grow until a stopping condition is met, like reaching a maximum tree depth or minimum number of observations allowed per node. Tree clean-up then takes place in a backward pass, where the following decision tree objective governs whether a tree branch is kept or removed \citep[p. 309]{james_introduction_2013}:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{dtree_objective}
%\begin{aligned}
%    J(\Theta) &= SSE + \alpha\left|T\right| \\
%    &= \sum_{m=1}^{\left|T\right|}{\sum_{i|x_i\epsilon R_m}}{(y_i-\hat{y}_m)^2+\alpha\left|T\right|}
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}

%Here, $\left|T\right|$ refers to the number of terminal nodes in tree $T$, $R_m$ is the subgroup of the training data associated with terminal node $m$, and $\hat{y}_m$ is the classification predicted by node $m$. If the sum of squared errors ($SSE$) in classification increases by less than $\alpha$ when a branch is removed, that branch will remain removed from the decision tree. $\alpha$ acts as a regularization parameter balancing prediction accuracy with model complexity; greater values of $\alpha$ result in simpler decision trees.

%\subsection{Tree Ensembles (XGBoost)}

%As simple and effective as decision tree classifiers may be, they only demonstrate a single model solution. And since random selection can play a role in their construction, completely different tree structures may arise if a tree is rebuilt on the same data set. The random forest algorithm embraces these random variations and generates a large number of decision trees. To increase randomness, only a subset of the predictors are used when building each tree, and the trees are trained on a different data subset selected at random and with replacement from the full training set \citep[p. 376--377]{bertsimas_analytics_2016}. Much like the classic “wisdom of crowds” paradigm, the collection of trees acts as a single, more performant ensemble model. However, greater possible accuracy in predictions from the ensemble trades off with less interpretability; as the forest grows larger, the number of constituent decision trees quickly exceeds the limits of human comprehension. As such, ensemble tree methods like random forests are considered black box algorithms.

%A variation in ensemble algorithms uses “gradient boosting,” where the trees in the ensemble are chained in succession and train on the residual error of the preceding tree. The trees are weak learners that underfit the data, giving them low variance, but high bias. Yet when the predictions of the models are summed together, the compound prediction can out-perform more conventional random forests \citep[p. 323]{james_introduction_2013}:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:xgb_form}
%    \hat{f}(x) = \sum_{b=1}^{B}{\alpha \hat{f}^{b}(x)}
%\end{equation}

%Where $\hat{f}(x)$ is the boosted model, $\hat{f}^b$ are the weak learners totaling $B$ in number. $\alpha$ is the shrinkage parameter or learning rate. 

%XGBoost is a variant of gradient-boosting tree algorithms, gaining a significant amount of notoriety from machine learning competition wins \citep{chen_dmlcxgboost_2021}. The objective function governing model construction balances two influences \citep{chen_xgboost_2016}:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:xgb_objective}
%\begin{aligned}
%    J(\Theta) &= L + \Omega \\
%    &= \sum_{i}{l(\hat{y}_i,y_i)}+\sum_{k}{\Omega(f_k)} \\
%    &= \sum_{i}{l(\hat{y}_i,y_i)}+\sum_{k}{\left({\gamma T}+\frac{1}{2} \lambda \sum_{j=1}^T{w_j^2}\right)}
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}

%Where the first part expresses how well the model fits the data (i.e., the loss), while the second term regulates the complexity of the model. Complexity is defined by the number of leaves in a tree ($T$) and the size of leaf weights ($w$) unique to XGBoost decision trees. After some additional derivations, the objective can be restated as: 

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:xgb_obj_simple}
%    J(\Theta) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j\;leaves}{\frac{G_j^2}{H_j + \lambda} + \gamma T}
%\end{equation}

%Where $G$ is the sum of the first-order gradient statistics for the instance set of leaf $j$, and $H$ is the sum of the second-order gradient statistics \citep{chen_xgboost_2016}. Tree construction follows that of decision trees --- split each node greedily to maximize tree depth, then prune back in a backward pass. The left term of equation \ref{eq:xgb_obj_simple} provides a means to calculate loss reduction for a candidate split, thus governing the evaluation of tree splits during the pruning process. 

%XGBoost is a complex algorithm, but with a lot of optimizations that make it extremely efficient, scalable, and popular among machine learning practitioners.

%\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}

%\subsubsection{Feature Selection}\label{ch5:xgb_shapley}

%As a tree-based machine learning method, XGBoost naturally provides feature importances as a product of model-fitting. The XGBoost package offers five kinds of global feature importance calculations \citep{xgboost_developers_xgboost_2020}, but each may give a slightly different ordering and suggested relative impact of the predictors in the feature set. At issue here are two concepts in importance definition methods: consistency, or the independence of a feature importance value and the reliance of a model on that feature, and local accuracy, or the idea that the sum of the importances is equivalent with the overall model importance \citep{lundberg_interpretable_2020}. A study of six different approaches to interpreting models through feature attribution showed most do not meet both desirable properties, with the exception of \acrlong{shap} (\acrshort{shap}) values \citep{lundberg_consistent_2019}.


%Shapley values derive from cooperative gain theory \citep{shapley_value_1997}, but have gained traction in the machine learning community partly because they predict importances without assuming complete feature independence \citep{lundberg_unified_2017}. In addition to managing collinearity, Shapley values have several desirable features. For example, if two features impact a model prediction equally, they will also have equivalent Shapley values. And a Shapley value of zero means the feature has no predictive impact. The SHAP method produces values that have global significance for general feature importance but also local significance for an individual prediction; the sum of SHAP values is equivalent to the deviation of the model prediction from the average value (baseline), meaning SHAP values describe the individual contributions of each feature to a prediction value \citep{lundberg_unified_2017}.

%\subsection{Neural Networks} \label{ch5:ann}

%\subsubsection{Model Concept}
%\label{ch5:ann_concept}

%The original concepts behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs or just \acrshort{nn}s) come from simplified models of neuron activity in the brain \citep[p.\ 394]{hastie_elements_2009}. At a high level, multiple inputs are fed into neuron cells from many branches on one end, and given the right combination of those inputs, these cells will fire and propagate a signal to the next group of connected neurons.

%In neural networks, cells are represented by logistic units (Figure \ref{fig:nn_schematic}). Each unit acts like a logistic regression operation, where inputs are scaled by weights, and the linear sum of the weighted inputs are passed through an “activation function” to determine if the output is a 0 or a 1. As in logistic regression, the sigmoid function (Equation \ref{eq:sigmoid}) commonly appears in network architectures, but many additional activation functions like the \acrlong{relu} (\acrshort{relu}) are frequently used as well \citep{brownlee_gentle_2019}.

%\begin{figure}[!htp]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{templates/images/Figure-ANN.png}
%\caption[Neural network schematic]{Schematic of a logistic unit (Left) and a fully-connected neural network (Right) with a single hidden layer made up of logistic units $a_1$ through $a_m$. Bias units (subscript 0) traditionally have a value of 1, but are weighted in linear combinations like other units. Four units in the output layer make this a four-class classifier.}
%\label{fig:nn_schematic}
%\end{figure}

%Each logistic unit performs the following operation:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:nn_activation}
%    {\bf{a}} = g({\bf{z}}) = g({\bf{W^TX}})
%\end{equation}
%\\
%where $g$ is the activation function and $\bf{W}$ are the weights. For the first hidden layer, $\bf{X}$ will be the predictor values from the input layer as shown in Figure \ref{fig:nn_schematic}. For any additional hidden layers, $\bf{X}$ consists of the outputs of units from the preceding layer. Here, $\bf{z}$ is described in matrix notation but has the same form as Equation \ref{eq:linreg_form}. 

%The cost function for a neural network takes on the form of a loss term and a complexity term \citep{ng_neural_2011}:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:nn_cost_function}
%    \begin{aligned}
%        J(\Theta) &= 
%        -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}{
%        L(\hat{y}_i, y_i)} + \frac{\lambda}{2m}
%        \sum_{l=1}^{L-1}{
%        \sum_{i=1}^{s_l}{
%        \sum_{j=1}^{s_{l+1}}{(w_{ij}^{l})^2}}} \\
%        &= -\frac{1}{m}
%        \sum_{i=1}^{m}{
%        \sum_{k=1}^{K}{
%        y_k^{(i)}\log{h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})_k}+
%        (1-y_k^{(i)})\log{(1-h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})_k)}}}\ + \\
%        &\qquad \frac{\lambda}{2m}
%        \sum_{l=1}^{L-1}{
%        \sum_{i=1}^{s_l}{
%        \sum_{j=1}^{s_{l+1}}{(w_{ij}^{l})^2}}}
%    \end{aligned}
%\end{equation}

%Which looks very similar to the regularized negative log likelihood cost function for logistic regression (Equation \ref{eq:logreg_cost_reg}). Here, $m$ is the number of predictor values in the input layer, $K$ is the number of outputs, $L$ is the number of layers, and $i$ and $j$ track the weights for layer $j$, unit $i$. $\lambda$ is a regularization term controlling the balance between the loss term and complexity term in the cost function. 

%As usual, minimizing this loss function is the goal of the NN learning process. This is generally accomplished using the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients needed for a gradient descent optimization \citep[p.\ 396]{hastie_elements_2009}.

%\subsection{Uncertainty Analysis}

%\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.45\textwidth}

%\caption[Uncertainty analysis workflow]{Workflow for analyzing uncertainties in model results for geothermal gradient prediction across the southwestern NM study area.}
%\label{fig:uncertainty_flow}
%\end{wrapfigure}

%The results obtained from the four supervised machine learning methods discussed so far all match the well data sets with at least an accuracy of 70\%, and in some cases in excess of 95\%. From a statistical perspective, each model accomplishes the task of learning from existing data reasonably well. And they all use those learnings to predict geothermal gradient classifications across the entire AOI. But presenting these results to an explorationist will invariably elicit two important questions: 1) Which of these model results is the right one? and 2) What actions should I take based on these models? 

%George Box's famous statement, “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful” \citep{box_empirical_1987} effectively answers the first question. But knowing that none of the prediction maps is individually correct falls short of providing impactful and actionable information for geothermal exploration decision-makers. Value lies in describing the sources of uncertainty and where those uncertainties manifest in a spatial prediction of geothermal gradient or other modeled attributes. To this end, the following analysis considers uncertainties from the three sources described in Section \ref{ch2:uncertainty} and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:uncertainty_flow}: model type (structural), model calibration (parameter), and model input (measurement).

%\subsubsection{Classification Uncertainty Measures}

%Unlike standard regression problems that result in continuous variable predictions, classifiers are inherently limited to selecting among $n$ discrete classes. Statistical measures of variability in model results cannot be calculated by methods like standard deviation. For geospatial classifications, the most basic comparison between two maps is visual; plotting two maps side-by-side as in Figure \ref{fig:nn_final_map} can effectively communicate qualitative differences. Quantifying the uncertainty of categorical predictions based on multiple realizations defines a more difficult problem, with a variety of different statistical approaches to consider. Among these are performance measures based on the class assignments, including the percent correctly classified (accuracy), confusion matrix, ROC AUC, Kappa \citep{cohen_coefficient_1960}, and weighted Tau \citep{ma_tau_1995}. Other methods consider the probabilities that precede the final classification choice, including Brier score \citep{brier_verification_1950} and Shannon entropy \citep{shannon_mathematical_1948}. Rather than perform an exhaustive search through different metrics, this thesis follows the recommendation of \citep{beaudette_accuracy_2020} in characterizing classification uncertainty using entropy. Although the classic entropy calculation does not account for class similarity, it shows good discrimination ability for model results with low, medium, and high stand-out probability for the majority class \citep{beaudette_accuracy_2020}. Entropy can be calculated as shown in Equation \ref{eq:entropy} and normalized to a range of $(0, 1]$ as described here:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:norm_entropy}
%    H = -\frac{1}{\log_2{(n)}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i \cdot \log_2{(p_i)}} = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i \cdot \log_n{(p_i)}}
%\end{equation}

%where $p_i$ represents the probability assigned to class label $i$. Entropy maps can be defined using the output probabilities of a single classification model or the results in an ensemble of predictions by first averaging across class probabilities for each map location.


%\subsubsection{Structural Uncertainty}\label{ch5:model_uncertainty}
%The specific choice of classification algorithm implicitly applies constraints on the solution space for the problem. For example, logistic regression solutions assume there is a linear relationship between predictor variables and the log-odds of the response variable. And decision trees use hard thresholds that can create step-like model behavior. 


%In order to examine the uncertainty introduced by structural aspects of the chosen machine learning models, the predicted class probabilities for each model output were averaged together to create an ensemble prediction of geothermal gradient classes.

%\subsubsection{Parameter Uncertainty} \label{ch5:param_uncertainty}

%The fitting procedure for machine learning models like logistic regression and neural networks involves minimizing a cost function as updates are iteratively made to model parameters, e.g., feature weights. However, the final model solutions typically present these parameters as deterministic values with no uncertainty. The complexity of neural networks, and the potential for different parameterizations as randomness in techniques like dropout and mini-batching influence the training process, suggest such representations under-characterize the model space. By defining the range of uncertainty on model parameters, it is possible to generate many solutions from the same model that define an ensemble of valid predictions. Uncertainty estimates derived from this ensemble can introduce a measure of confidence in a model’s output, allowing the model to directly explain what it knows and, more importantly, what it doesn’t know in the solutions it produces.

%The Google DeepMind team introduced a method called “Bayes by Backprop” in 2015 where single-value weights are replaced by probability distributions in a neural network architecture \citep{blundell_weight_2015}. Making the simplifying assumption that the weight distributions are Gaussian, each weight parameter in a standard NN layer is replaced by a mean and a standard deviation in a probabilistic layer. A fully-trained \acrlong{bnn} (\acrshort{bnn}) samples from the weight distributions for just-in-time determination of weight values as data is fed through to produce a prediction. Therefore, each prediction of the BNN varies depending on the selected weights, and running the network many times on the same data set will produce a set of different results. An analysis of the variation in this solution ensemble can characterize how parameter uncertainty impacts BNN classification performance.

%At a fundamental level, BNNs operate using Bayes theorem for training the network \citep{webster_probabilistic_2021}:

%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:bayesrule}
%    P({\bf w} \vert D) = \frac{P(D \vert {\bf w}) \cdot P({\bf w})}{P(D)}
%\end{equation}

%Where ${\bf w}$ are the model weights, $D$ is the observed data. $P({\bf w})$ define the \textit{priors}, or the distributions assigned to the weights before seeing $D$. $P(D \vert {\bf w})$ defines the likelihood of $D$ given $w$. $P({\bf w} \vert D)$ are the \textit{posteriors} or the distributions after taking $D$ into account.

%In practice, BNNs use a Variational Bayes method, which approximates $P({\bf w} \vert D)$ with a variational posterior, $q({\bf w} \vert \theta)$. The desired difference between these two functions is zero (perfect approximation), so this defines the basis of a loss function measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence \citep{webster_probabilistic_2021}:

%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:bnn_loss}
%    \begin{aligned}
%    D_{KL}\left(q({\bf w} \vert \theta)\ \vert\vert\ P({\bf w} \vert D)\right) &= \int{q({\bf w} \vert \theta) \log \left({\frac{q({\bf w} \vert \theta)}{P({\bf w} \vert D)}}\right) d{\bf w}} \\
%    &= \log P(D) + D_{KL}\left(q({\bf w} \vert \theta)\ \vert\vert\ P({\bf w})\right) \\ 
%    &\qquad- \mathbf{E}_{q({\bf w} \vert \theta)}\left[\log P(D \vert {\bf w})\right]
%    \end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%Dropping constant terms and treating this as an objective to minimize \citep{blundell_weight_2015}:
%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:bnn_objective}
%    J(\Theta) = D_{KL}\left(q({\bf w} \vert \theta)\ \vert\vert\ P({\bf w})\right) - \mathbf{E}_{q({\bf w} \vert \theta)}\left[\log P(D \vert {\bf w})\right]
%\end{equation}

%This two-term objective describes a trade-off between the complexity as controlled by deviation from the prior ($P({\bf w})$) and the negative log-likelihood term measuring the fit to the data.

%\subsubsection{Measurement Uncertainty}\label{ch5:measure_uncertainty}

%Data modeling and analytics generally begin with the collection, engineering, and conditioning of features of interest. Building the perfect dataframe for machine learning may be the first priority, but capturing standard error estimates for its constituent features is fundamental to understanding how much uncertainty they bring to the prediction problem.
