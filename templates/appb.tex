\section{Static NPV Model}\label{app:B_static_model}
The static model described in Section \ref{ch4:cm_concept} was implemented in Microsoft Excel as a single sheet for cost analysis. Figures \ref{fig:static_model_sheet1} and \ref{fig:static_model_sheet2} show the model when flow rate is pre-defined and capacity depends on the input temperature of the produced brine. Not shown is the supporting look-up table for the EIA STEO-based electricity price forecast (Figure \ref{fig:electricity_pricing}).
