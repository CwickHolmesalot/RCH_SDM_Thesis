\section{Static NPV Model}\label{app:B_static_model}
The static model described in Section \ref{ch4:cm_concept} was implemented in Microsoft Excel as a single worksheet for cost analysis. Figures \ref{fig:static_model_sheet1} and \ref{fig:static_model_sheet2} show the model when flow rate is pre-defined and capacity depends on the input temperature of the produced brine. Not shown is the supporting look-up table for the EIA STEO-based electricity price forecast (Figure \ref{fig:electricity_pricing}).

\section{Probabilistic NPV Models}\label{app:B_flex_models}
The probabilistic NPV model was implemented as an extension of the static NPV model in Excel, with variable look-ups using the PDFs described in Section \ref{ch4:pdfs}. Flexible design options described in Section \ref{ch4:flex_design_options} were implemented as decision rules in the cash flow analysis. Figures \ref{fig:probabilistic_model_sheet1} and \ref{fig:probabilistic_model_sheet2} illustrate the spreadsheet for the Full Flexibility case (see Section \ref{ch4:flex_reduce_case}). The results histogram, target curve, and summary statistics were generated using a 2000-row data table tied to the NPV calculation cell (not shown).
