	abstract = {Heat-flow data along La Ristra seismic line crossing New Mexico from the Colorado Plateau to the Great Plains suggest that the Jemez Lineament and the Rio Grande rift are high heat-flow geologic provinces, which, from the heat-flow data, appear separated by a triangular wedge of Colorado Plateau. Estimated mid-depths of upper-mantle thermal sources for the Jemez Lineament and the Rio Grande rift generally agree with the mid-depths of the greatest upper-mantle seismic velocity anomalies, supporting the suggestion that these seismic anomalies are caused in part by increased temperature. Mid-depths of shallower thermal sources are near the mid-depth between the top of the crustal seismic velocity anomaly and the top of the upper-mantle seismic anomaly. Heat flow returns to intermediate values in the Colorado Plateau and the eastern rift flank of the Rio Grande rift, suggesting similar crustal and upper-mantle thermal conditions in the two regions and low values in the Great Plains, indicating cooler crustal and upper-mantle temperatures. Heat-flow values are generally consistent with seismic velocities, although differences between the data sets are observed for the Rio Grande rift eastern flank.},

	abstract = {A continental graben structure or rift is a narrow, elongated, fault-bounded structure in the Earth’s crust (Fig. 3.1). Grabens consist of a central axial depression flanked by steep walls and elevated shoulders that plunge steeply into the rift axis and slope gradually towards the exterior (Fig. 3.2). The most famous example is the East African rift system. Rift systems may be cut and apparently offset by transform faults; examples include the Upper Rhine Graben in Central Europe and its southern continuation in the Bresse and Rhône grabens (see below). Graben structures occur in regions where the crust and lithospheric mantle are extended and thinned (Fig. 3.3). Broad regions of extension are typically expressed by numerous grabens and intervening higher horst blocks such as the Basin and Range Province in western North America. Graben systems also occur in oceanic crust along mid-ocean ridge systems and will be discussed in Chapter 5.},

Seismic-velocity and potential-field modeling provides new control on the Mesozoic-to-present tectonic evolution of this poorly understood portion of the U.S. Cordillera. We document ∼20\% crustal thinning associated with Basin and Range extension from a crustal thickness of ∼37 km under northeastern California to ∼31 km under northwestern Nevada that is consistent with the amount of extension recorded in the upper crust in northwestern Nevada, suggesting the crustal response to extension was relatively homogeneous over the entire crustal column. Our modeling also shows a well-defined, 80-km-wide zone of unusually low upper-crustal velocities (∼5.9–6.1 km/s) that coincide with the surface location of sparse Cretaceous granites, locating the elusive northern extension of the Sierra Nevada batholith through northwestern Nevada for the first time in the subsurface. Combining geological and geophysical data, we reconstruct the late Cretaceous-to-present crustal evolution of this region, documenting an interplay between magmatic addition to the crust, erosional exhumation, sedimentation, and extension that has reversed the direction of crustal thinning from a west-facing continental margin to an east-facing interior basin margin over this time interval. Finally, we find no evidence in northwestern Nevada for unusually thick crust ({\textgreater}40 km) prior to Basin and Range extension.},

	abstract = {The Rio Grande rift of the southwestern United States is one of the world's principal continental rift systems. It extends as a series of asymmetrical grabens from central Colorado, through New Mexico, to Presidio, Texas, and Chihuahua, Mexico—a distance of more than 1000 km. Although the Rio Grande rift is closely related in timing and structural style to the contiguous Basin and Range extensional province, the two can be distinguished by a variety of geological and geophysical signatures. Rifts (both oceanic and continental) can be defined as elongate depressions overlying places where the entire lithosphere has ruptured in extension. The lithosphere of the Rio Grande rift conforms to this definition, in that: 1.(1) the crust is moderately thinned—Moho depths range from about 45 km under the flanks to about 33 km beneath the rift axis.2.(2) anomalously low Pn velocities (7.6–7.8 km s−1) beneath the rift and a long wavelength gravity low suggest that the asthenosphere is in contact with the base of the crust. The P-velocity is abnormally low (6.4–6.5 km s−1) in the lower half of the crust beneath the rift, suggesting high crustal temperatures. However, associated seismic and volcanologic data indicate the sub-rift lower crust is not dominated by a massive composite mafic intrusion such as is sometimes inferred for the East African rifts. Seismic and magnetotelluric data suggest the presence of a thin ({\textless} 1 km) sill-like contemporary midcrustal magma body which may perhaps extend intermittently along much of the length of the rift. Seismic and structural studies indicate a dominant horizontal fabric in the upper and middle crust. The brittle-ductile transition is at depths −15 km except for the major volcanic fields, where it rises to 2–3 km. Structural development of the rift occurred mainly during two time intervals: the early phase beginning at −30 Ma. and lasting 10–12 m.y., and the late phase extending from −10 to 3 Ma. The early phase involved extensive low-angle normal faulting throughout the rift region which was subsequently offset by high-angle normal faulting during the later deformational event. Volcanism of the Rio Grande rift is minor compared to some other continental rifts. Most of the volcanism is basaltic and occurred less than about 5 m.y. ago. Compositions range from alkalic to tholeiitic, with no unique spatial or temporal pattern. Magmas were probably derived from a variety of depths, indicating an unintegrated heat source with only local melting. Basaltic andesites and related calc-alkaline rocks erupted in the southern rift between about 30 and 18 m.y. ago were not uniquely related to the rifting process. Rather, the thermal pulse which generated these magmas was part of the previous, subduction-related event. Our interpretation of existing data concerning the evolution of the Rio Grande rift does not fit either simple active or passive “end-member” models. In particular, there is no compelling evidence for a major thermal event in the mantle uniquely associated with rifting. Yet heat—inherited from the immediately-preceding deformational regime—was certainly a critical factor in, and was probably a necessary condition for, rifting.},

	abstract = {Recent national focus on the value of increasing US supplies of indigenous renewable energy underscores the need for re-evaluating all alternatives, particularly those that are large and well distributed nationally. A panel was assembled in September 2005 to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of geothermal becoming a major supplier of primary energy for US base-load generation capacity by 2050. Primary energy produced from both conventional hydrothermal and enhanced (or engineered) geothermal systems (EGS) was considered on a national scale. This paper summarizes the work of the panel which appears in complete form in a 2006 MIT report, 'The future of geothermal energy' parts 1 and 2. In the analysis, a comprehensive national assessment of US geothermal resources, evaluation of drilling and reservoir technologies and economic modelling was carried out. The methodologies employed to estimate geologic heat flow for a range of geothermal resources were utilized to provide detailed quantitative projections of the EGS resource base for the USA. Thirty years of field testing worldwide was evaluated to identify the remaining technology needs with respect to drilling and completing wells, stimulating EGS reservoirs and converting geothermal heat to electricity in surface power and energy recovery systems. Economic modelling was used to develop long-term projections of EGS in the USA for supplying electricity and thermal energy. Sensitivities to capital costs for drilling, stimulation and power plant construction, and financial factors, learning curve estimates, and uncertainties and risks were considered.},

	abstract = {In the present work, we report the results of a multi-isotopic study (δ7Li, δ11B and 87Sr/86Sr) on waters collected from different hydro-and geothermal sites in France. The aim of this study was to characterize hydro-and geothermal reservoirs by coupling a multi-isotopic approach with in-depth temperature of the reservoir calculated using chemical geothermometers. A database constituted by 36 water samples (thermal, thermo-mineral and geothermal waters) was selected in order to cover a wide range of temperatures and to be representative of water/rock interactions with various types of lithologies. We clearly observed that the wide range of 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios in the waters (0.70755-0.72187) appear to be largely controlled by the dominant host lithologies with Sr isotopic signatures ranging from high values (resulting from interaction from granite and/or gneiss type {\textgreater}0.714) to lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios (closer to Sr isotopic ratios observed in the sedimentary zones {\textless}0.712). Boron isotopic ratios lay between -8.3 and +21.6‰, also reflecting a lithological control over δ11B signatures. In addition, no simple or direct relationship was observed for either boron or strontium isotopic signatures with the temperature of the reservoir. In contrast, temperature plays an important role in controlling the lithium isotope composition of the hydro-and geothermal fluids. δ7Li signatures are comprised between -0.1 and +10.0‰ for temperatures ranging from 60 to 230 °C. This result seems to prove that lithium isotopic systematics represents a useful tool suitable for the characterization of hydrothermal and geothermal waters and suggests that the δ7Li composition of geothermal waters may be utilised as a geothermometer (δ7Li=-0.043±0.003 T+11.9±0.5).},

	abstract = {We have developed an interpretive seismic workflow that incorporates multicomponent seismic inversion, guided by structural mapping, for characterizing low-permeability unconventional reservoirs. The workflow includes the determination of a calibrated time-depth relationship, generation of seismic-derived structural maps, poststack inversion, amplitude-variation-with-offset analysis, and PP-PS joint inversion. The subsequent interpretation procedure combines structural and inversion results with seismic-derived lithologic parameters, such as the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and brittleness index. We applied this workflow to a 3D multicomponent seismic data set from the Duvernay play in the Kaybob area in Alberta, Canada. Subtle faults are discernible using isochron maps, horizontal time slices, and seismic stratal slices. Fault-detection software is also used to aid in the delineation of structural discontinuities. We found that seismic-derived attributes, coupled with structural mapping, can be used to map reservoir facies and thus to highlight zones that are most favorable for hydraulic-fracture stimulation. By imaging structural discontinuities and preexisting zones of weakness, seismic mapping also contributes to an improved framework for understanding the induced-seismicity risk.},

	abstract = {Modern data enhancement techniques allow the AAPG geothermal survey of North America to use temperature data from oil, gas, and water wells in determining the thermal regimes of the continent. Without treatment these data would not be usable. Individual well bore temperature measurements may be highly inaccurate. Valid and invalid data are indistinguishable. Yet temperature measurements in well bores are the only data supply large enough to permit a continent-wide geothermal survey. A technique for making these data usable had to be developed. A two dimensional smoothing or filtering operation will be used in areas of high data density. The method is similar to those employed in improving the quality of satellite transmitted photographic data. Typically a weighted average of data in the neighborhood of a datum point is used for the value at that point. If the central datum differs too much from its neighbours, it is discarded. This precludes spreading a noise burst and thus eliminates one source of false regional anomalies. Because this procedure may also eliminate strong local anomalies, all discorded points will be designated on the final maps. The weights used to average neighboring data points are determined theoretically via communications theory. This theory also provides reliable estimates of error magnitude. Computed error magnitudes will be used to select contour intervals on all final maps. The validity of these data enhancement techniques will be checked by comparing the final maps against all known reliable geothermal gradient determinations in North America. Some of these have been made by scientists under controlled conditions specifically to determine geothermal gradients. Most are simply accurate measurements of steady state temperature in deep oil and gas reservoirs. Preliminary results indicate excellent agreement. In sparse data areas, standard smoothing and filtering techniques are of questionable value and are not used in the survey. Instead trend surfaces are fitted to the data. The nature of the surface used to depict geothermal gradient in any given area depends on both the internal consistency of the data and on its density. A completed geothermal survey of North America is the first step in assessing the thermal resources of the continent. It also provides scientists with information essential to the study of hydrocarbon maturation, sediment diagenesis and many other important geologic processes. Thanks to modern techniques of communications theory, the survey is feasible and should be completed on schedule by the end of 1974.},

	abstract = {This study applies a socio-technical systems perspective to explore innovation dynamics of two emerging energy technologies with potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electrical power generation in the United States: carbon capture and storage (CCS) and enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). The goal of the study is to inform sustainability science theory and energy policy deliberations by examining how social and political dynamics are shaping the struggle for resources by these two emerging, not-yet-widely commercializable socio-technical systems. This characterization of socio-technical dynamics of CCS and EGS innovation includes examining the perceived technical, environmental, and financial risks and benefits of each system, as well as the discourses and actor networks through which the competition for resources – particularly public resources – is being waged. CCS and EGS were selected for the study because they vary considerably with respect to their social, technical, and environmental implications and risks, are unproven at scale and uncertain with respect to cost, feasibility, and life-cycle environmental impacts. By assessing the two technologies in parallel, the study highlights important social and political dimensions of energy technology innovation in order to inform theory and suggest new approaches to policy analysis.},

The document is not claiming to be complete in terms of listing all technical details but gives an extensive overview. It is listing all relevant internal and external technical reports as references for additional reading if someone has to find supplementary information.
The Habanero reservoir will be described in detail after summarizing exploration, drilling and stimulation activities. This includes petrological description of the host rock (Big Lake Suite Granite) as well as reservoir environmental conditions and reservoir fluid chemistry.
Technologies will be explained which were used to identify faults/fractures within the granite. The Habanero Fault model will be presented and the geomechanical conditions discussed.
A major step forward for the recent understanding of the reservoir was the completion of the reservoir modelling after the Habanero 4 stimulation and testing operations. The results delivered crucial input for Habanero Field Development Plan.
The conclusions presented at the end of this report are the results of a learning process lasting more than 12 years. There is no doubt that the interpretation of the data available to date and the modelling work performed so far will change with every new bit of information which might be added through future exploration and drilling.},

	abstract = {The Northwest Geysers Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) demonstration project aims to create an EGS by directly and systematically injecting cool water at relatively low pressure into a known High Temperature (280–400 °C) Zone (HTZ) located under the conventional (240 °C) geothermal steam reservoir at The Geysers geothermal field in California. In this paper, the results of coupled thermal, hydraulic, and mechanical (THM) analyses made using a model developed as part of the pre-stimulation phase of the EGS demonstration project is presented. The model simulations were conducted in order to investigate injection strategies and the resulting effects of cold-water injection upon the EGS system; in particular to predict the extent of the stimulation zone for a given injection schedule. The actual injection began on October 6, 2011, and in this paper a comparison of pre-stimulation model predictions with micro-earthquake (MEQ) monitoring data over the first few months of a one-year injection program is presented. The results show that, by using a calibrated THM model based on historic injection and MEQ data at a nearby well, the predicted extent of the stimulation zone (defined as a zone of high MEQ density around the injection well) compares well with observed seismicity. The modeling indicates that the MEQ events are related to shear reactivation of preexisting fractures, which is triggered by the combined effects of injection-induced cooling around the injection well and small changes in steam pressure as far as half a kilometer away from the injection well. Pressure-monitoring data at adjacent wells and satellite-based ground-surface deformation data were also used to validate and further calibrate reservoir-scale hydraulic and mechanical model properties. The pressure signature monitored from the start of the injection was particularly useful for a precise back-calculation of reservoir porosity. The first few months of reservoir pressure and surface deformation data were useful for estimating the reservoir-rock permeability and elastic modulus. Finally, although the extent of the calculated stimulation zone matches the field observations over the first few months of injection, the observed surface deformations and MEQ evolution showed more heterogeneous behavior as a result of more complex geology, including minor faults and fracture zones that are important for consideration in the analysis of energy production and the long-term evolution of the EGS system.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a review of the worldwide applications of geothermal energy for direct utilization and updates the previous survey carried out in 2015. We also compare data from WGC1995, WGC2000, WGC2005, WGC2010, and WGC2015 presented at World Geothermal Congresses in Italy, Japan, Turkey, Indonesia and Australia. As in previous reports, an effort is made to quantify geothermal (ground-source) heat pump data. The present report is based on country update papers received from 62 countries and regions reporting on their direct utilization of geothermal energy. Twenty-six additional countries were added to the list based on other sources of information. Thus, direct utilization of geothermal energy in a total of 88 countries is an increase from 82 in 2015, 78 reported in 2010, 72 reported in 2005, 58 reported in 2000, and 28 reported in 1995. An estimation of the installed thermal power for direct utilization at the end of 2019 is used in this paper and equals 107,727 MWt, a 52.0 \% increase over the 2015 data, growing at a compound rate of 8.73 \% annually. The thermal energy used is 1,020,887 TJ/yr (283,580 GW h/yr.), a 72.3 \% increase over 2015, growing at a compound rate of 11.5 \% annually. The distribution of thermal energy used by category is approximately 58.8 \% for geothermal (ground-source) heat pumps, 18.0 \% for bathing and swimming (including balneology), 16.0 \% for space heating (of which 91.0 \% is for district heating), 3.5 \% for greenhouse heating, 1.6 \% for industrial applications, 1.3 \% for aquaculture pond and raceway heating, 0.4 \% for agricultural drying, 0.2 \% for snow melting and cooling, and 0.2 \% for other applications. Energy savings amounts to 596 million barrels (81.0 million tonnes) of equivalent oil annually, preventing 78.1 million tonnes of carbon and 252.6 million tonnes of CO2 from being released to the atmosphere. This includes savings for geothermal heat pumps in the cooling mode, compared to using fuel oil to generate electricity. Since it is almost impossible to separate direct-use from electric power generation for the following, they are combined: approximately 2647 wells were drilled in 42 countries, 34,500 person-years of effort were allocated in 59 countries, and US \$22.262 billion invested in projects by 53 countries.},

	abstract = {Under climate change, many species are increasingly exposed to heatwaves, including marine species. Although marine species are expected to succumb to heatwaves, there is increasing interest in understanding why some can persist. As heatwaves can greatly elevate intertidal seawater temperature, we explore reasons for variation in biological performance to acute thermal stress among three species of intertidal gastropods. When thermal refuges were unavailable for adaptive behavior, we show that their biological performance (feeding rate) was either maintained (resistant), recovered from a decline (resilient), or collapsed (sensitive), depending on the strength of molecular defense (where resistant species {\textbackslash}textgreater resilient species {\textbackslash}textgreater sensitive species). The integration of molecular, physiological, and behavioral responses within a species illustrates the kind of adaptive capacity that allows organisms to survive heatwaves and maintain their ecological functions. In this era of unprecedented environmental change, understanding how organisms persist seems as important as understanding how organisms perish.},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to characterize the uncertainty associated with the cost of drilling and completion of geothermal wells. Previous research and publications have produced correlations for the average cost of geothermal wells as a function of well depth. This project develops this concept further by using a probabilistic approach to evaluate the distribution of geothermal well costs for a range of well depths. The well cost uncertainty was characterized by identifying the main cost components of geothermal wells and quantifying the probability distributions of the key variables controlling these costs. These probability distributions were determined based on the detailed cost records of U.S. geothermal wells drilled or designed from 2009 to 2013 as well as cost data from drilling equipment manufacturers and vendors. Probability distributions of the key variables were examined to find statistically significant correlations between them. Lastly, the previously determined probability distributions of individual cost components and the correlations between them were input into WellCost Lite, a predictive geothermal drilling cost model, using the Monte Carlo method. This approach allowed us to generate the overall well cost probability distributions for 8000–15,000ft. (2400–4600m) geothermal wells. We have shown that the median geothermal well cost increases exponentially with depth. Deep wells typically have higher cost uncertainty and more positively-skewed cost probability distributions. The correlations presented in this paper can be used to determine the economic feasibility of geothermal energy systems, assess the project risk, and facilitate investment decisions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic methodology for the optimal design of geothermal systems. First, the different components of the system superstructure are separately modeled using flowsheeting software. The superstructure includes the different conversion technologies, the potential resources and the demand profiles in energy services. It covers a wide panel of conventional resources and technologies like deep and shallow aquifers, heat pumps, organic Rankine cycles for combined heat and power production, as well as emerging resources and technologies, like enhanced geothermal systems. Then, resources, technologies and demand profiles models are integrated together using process integration techniques. The configuration of the geothermal system is hence extracted from the superstructure. Finally, the performance of the integrated system is calculated and includes energy and exergy efficiency, investment costs, operating costs and district heating or electricity levelized costs. To account for the seasonal variations of the demand, a multi-period approach is used for the simulation of the superstructure, its integration and the performance calculation. The overall sequence is implemented in a multi-objective optimization framework. The methodology is illustrated by an application case study. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of important effects to be accounted for in the design of geothermal systems.},

	url = {https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/oil-and-gas-industry-outlook.html},
	abstract = {Facing the challenge of transformation for the oil and gas industry Since we published our midyear outlook in July, the global economy and capital markets have rebounded faster than expected in the third quarter of 2020. However, the pace of recovery in the coming months remains highly uncertain as mounting COVID-19 cases amid winter conditions, especially in Europe and the United States, may trigger another round of shutdowns and restrictions. Any further normalization of economic activity largely depends on how the pandemic evolves during the winter and, most importantly, when COVID-19 vaccines reach the general public. Even when the virus is controlled, economies are expected to continue dealing with the adverse impact of deteriorated fiscal balances and the effect of muted business investment on the labor market and consumer spending in 2021. What does this mean for the oil and gas (O\&G) industry? Global oil demand fell by 25\% in April, but it has rebounded sharply since then, cutting its losses to just 8\%. Looking ahead, 2021 oil demand is expected to recover strongly but remain lower than it was at pre–COVID-19 levels—about 4\% lower in the base case, and about 7\% lower in Rystad Energy’s second-wave scenario. Similarly, oil prices and energy stocks have underperformed base metals and the broader S\&P 500 index by about 10\% and 25\% and 6\% and 10\%, respectively, since July 2020. Mass layoffs and heightened cyclicality in employment continue to challenge the industry’s reputation as a reliable employer. US O\&G companies laid off about 14\% of permanent employees in 2020, and our research shows that 70\% of jobs lost during the pandemic may not come back by the end of 2021. Although the oil and gas sector is used to the highs and lows of economic and price cycles, this downturn seems unlike any other. In fact, it’s the “great compression” of the O\&G industry. With the survival of many companies at risk, and the longer-term decline in petroleum demand, the next decade could look very different for the entire O\&G value chain. 2021 will either be a leapfrog year or a test of endurance for many. We see five oil and gas trends that may challenge traditional methods of oil and gas production in 2021, determine the direction of the industry, and begin separating the pioneers from the followers.},

After averaging \$2/b lower than Brent prices through the first eight months of 2017, WTI prices averaged \$6/b lower than Brent prices from September through November. • NYMEX WTI contract values for March 2018 delivery traded during the five-day period ending December 7, 2017, suggest that a range of \$48/b to \$68/b encompasses the market expectation for March WTI prices at the 95\% confidence level. • EIA estimates that U.S. crude oil production averaged 9.7 million barrels per day (b/d) in November, up 360,000 b/d from the October level. Most of the increase was in the Gulf of Mexico, where production was 290,000 b/d higher than in October. Higher production in November reflected oil production platforms returning to operation after being shut in response to Hurricane Nate. EIA forecasts total U.S. crude oil production to average 9.2 million b/d for all of 2017 and 10.0 million b/d in 2018, which would mark the highest annual average production, surpassing the previous record of 9.6 million b/d set in 1970. • U.S. regular gasoline retail prices averaged \$2.56 per gallon (gal) in November, an increase of nearly 6 cents/gal from the average in October. The increase in November primarily reflected increasing crude oil prices.

	title = {{EGS} {Designs} with {Horizontal} {Wells}, {Multiple} {Stages}, and {Proppant}},
	abstract = {In Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), hydraulic stimulation is used to improve well productivity. EGS is typically performed in a nearly vertical well, in one stage, with no proppant. In the past several years, the oil and gas industry has achieved radical improvements in stimulation performance by using multiple stages, proppant, and horizontal (or deviated) wells. For the most part, these technologies have not been adopted in EGS. The EGS community is focused on the concept of "shear stimulation," injecting water to induced slip on self-propping natural fractures. As a result, proppant is viewed as being unnecessary or ineffective. The use of packers to enable multiple stages is considered technically infeasible because EGS wells are completed openhole (to maximize connectivity to natural fractures) and reliable openhole packers are not available at high temperature. In this paper, we discuss an EGS design that relies on creating new fractures, rather than stimulating natural fractures. In this design, a horizontal (or deviated) well is drilled and completed with cemented casing. Cased hole packers or bridge plugs are used for zonal isolation, allowing multiple stage fracture treatments to be pumped through perforations in the casing. Proppant is injected, possibly along with a viscosifying agent. We performed simple calculations to estimate the potential effect of multiple stages and proppant on the flow rate that can sustained through an EGS doublet. These calculations were intended to give rough estimates and provide a sensitivity analysis, not provide detailed analysis. We found that an EGS design with multiple stages and proppant should give dramatically improved economic performance relative to current designs. With enough stages, flow rate will be limited more by pressure loss in the wellbores than in the reservoir. We did not perform calculations on thermal breakthrough, but we expect that the use of multiple stages would help improve reservoir contact and prevent premature thermal breakthrough. We reviewed the literature in order to assess the technical viability of our proposed design. It was found that cased hole packers rated to geothermal temperatures are available with current technology. A review of EGS field experience shows that in the rare cases when proppants have been used, they have consistently improved well productivity, even in granite. There is some laboratory evidence to suggest proppants may chemically degrade over time at high temperature, but there is also evidence that certain coated proppants are resistant to degradation. The proposed design would increase cost but deliver radical improvements in flow rate (and revenue) per well.},

	abstract = {This paper evaluates current and historical drilling and completion costs of oil and gas wells and compares them with geothermal wells costs. As a starting point, we developed a new cost index for US onshore oil and gas wells based primarily on the API Joint Association Survey 1976–2009 data. This index describes year-to-year variations in drilling costs and allows one to express historical drilling expenditures in current year dollars. To distinguish from other cost indices we have labeled it the Cornell Energy Institute (CEI) Index. This index has nine sub-indices for different well depth intervals and has been corrected for yearly changes in drilling activity. The CEI index shows 70\% higher increase in well cost between 2003 and 2008 compared to the commonly used Producer Price Index (PPI) for drilling oil and gas wells. Cost trends for various depths were found to be significantly different and explained in terms of variations of oil and gas prices, costs, and availability of major well components and services at particular locations. Multiple methods were evaluated to infer the cost-depth correlation for geothermal wells in current year dollars. In addition to analyzing reported costs of the most recently completed geothermal wells, we investigated the results of the predictive geothermal well cost model WellCost Lite. Moreover, a cost database of 146 historical geothermal wells has been assembled. The CEI index was initially used to normalize costs of these wells to current year dollars. A comparison of normalized costs of historical wells with recently drilled ones and WellCost Lite predictions shows that cost escalation rates of geothermal wells were considerably lower compared to hydrocarbon wells and that a cost index based on hydrocarbon wells is not applicable to geothermal well drilling. Besides evaluating the average well costs, this work examined economic improvements resulting from increased drilling experience. Learning curve effects related to drilling multiple similar wells within the same field were correlated.},

GEOPHIRES combines reservoir, wellbore, and surface plant technical models with cost correlations and levelized cost models to estimate the capital and operation and maintenance costs, instantaneous and lifetime energy production, and overall levelized cost of energy of a geothermal plant. In addition to electricity generation, direct-use heat applications and combined heat and power or cogeneration can be modeled. Various upgrades have been implemented to develop GEOPHIRES v2.0, including: updating the built-in cost correlations, coupling to the external reservoir simulator TOUGH2, enhancing the built-in wellbore simulator, converting the programming language to Python, and making the code open-source. Users are encouraged to build upon the tool, e.g., by implementing their own correlations or coupling to other simulators. In this paper, we discuss the GEOPHIRES v2.0 objectives and history, and we present the software architecture as well as built-in models and correlations. We include two example simulations and quick-start guide on how to run a simulation.},

	abstract = {Wellbore drilling for any resource extraction—and particularly for EGS—is subject to many uncertainties, ranging from those related to geology to those related to the drilling procedures. Since well drilling and related subsurface activities for EGS represent a significant portion (above 50\%) of the total EGS development cost, assessing the risk is essential. This requires that one can estimate the cost and time uncertainties for EGS well drilling. The paper describes a method and associated computer code, the Decision Aids for Tunneling (DAT) that have been adapted to EGS well drilling. Very importantly, the paper shows a detailed application to the case that was originally developed by Sandia National Laboratories. This was done in form of parametric studies, in which uncertainty in cost components, in trouble events, in geology, and in temperature related effects were investigated separately and then in combination. This not only shows that the DAT are well suited for this purpose but it also provides a guideline for interested users. Most importantly, all this shows that wellbore drilling cost and time that are subject to a variety of uncertainties can be systematically assessed.},

	abstract = {Yitong Basin is located in subfrigid zone, and it has a good prospect to use geothermal clean heating. The evaluation of economic efficiency for heating with enhanced geothermal system (EGS) is indispensable. A simplified single-fracture hydrothermal coupling model with laboratory test is developed in the EGS project to calculate temperature and pressure based on Yitong Basin data. The effects of four factors (K, q, D, and T) on heat production and reservoir characteristics are discussed. The parameters and results of H-T coupling were applied to economic analysis for heating with EGS from private and social perspectives considering costs and revenues. The results indicate that the combination of laboratory tests (rock physical properties) makes the numerical simulation results more suitable for the study area. The production temperature and heating power will decrease with continuous injection of cold water, and the injection pressure and flow impedance will increase due to the increase in μ/ρ. Four factors (K, q, D, and T) will affect difficulty of fluid injection and reservoir thermal breakthrough, and the high injection rate q may trigger secondary fracturing of reservoir. Heating with EGS in single-fracture model was uneconomical due to expensive drilling costs. However, heating with EGS can be considered from social perspective based on environment, which can provide advice for decision-making of the government and business.},

	title = {Strategic energy planning under uncertainty},
	url = {http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/231814},
	abstract = {Various countries and communities are defining or rethinking their energy strategy driven by concerns for climate change and security of energy supply. Energy models, often based on optimization, can support this decision-making process. In the current energy planning practice, most models are deterministic, i.e. they do not consider uncertainty and rely on long-term forecasts for important parameters. However, over the long time horizons of energy planning, forecasts often prove to be inaccurate, which can lead to overcapacity and underutilization of the installed technologies. Although this shows the need of considering uncertainty in energy planning, uncertainty is to date seldom integrated in energy models. The main barriers to a wider penetration of uncertainty are i) the complexity and computational expense of energy models; ii) the issue of quantifying input uncertainties and determining their nature; iii) the selection of appropriate methods for incorporating uncertainties in energy models. To overcome these limitations, this thesis answers the following research question How does uncertainty impact strategic energy planning and how can we facilitate the integration of uncertainty in the energy modeling practice? with four novel methodological contributions. First, a mixed-integer linear programming modeling framework for large-scale energy systems is presented. Given the energy demand, the efficiency and cost of energy conversion technologies, the availability and cost of resources, the model identifies the optimal investment and operation strategies to meet the demand and minimize the total annual cost or greenhouse gas emissions. The concise formulation and low computational time make it suitable for uncertainty applications. Second, a method is introduced to characterize input uncertainties in energy planning models. Third, the adoption of a two-stage global sensitivity analysis approach is proposed to deal with the large number of uncertain parameters in energy planning models. Fourth, a complete robust optimization framework is developed to incorporate uncertainty in optimization-based energy models, allowing to consider uncertainty both in the objective function and in the other constraints. To evaluate the impact of uncertainty, the presentation of the methods is systematically associated to their validation on the real case study of the Swiss energy system. In this context, a novelty is represented by the consideration of all uncertain parameters in the analysis. The main finding is that uncertainty dramatically impacts energy planning decisions. The results reveal that uncertainty levels vary significantly for different parameters, and that the way in which uncertainty is characterized has a strong impact on the results. In the case study, economic parameters, such as the discount rate and the price of imported resources, are the most impacting inputs; also, parameters which are commonly considered as fixed assumptions in energy models emerge as critical factors, which shows that it is crucial to avoid an a priori exclusion of parameters from the analysis. The energy strategy drastically changes if uncertainty is considered. In particular, it is demonstrated that robust solutions, characterized by a higher penetration of renewables and of efficient technologies, can offer more reliability and stability compared to investment plans made without accounting for uncertainty, at the price of a marginally higher cost.},

The values of energy efficiency, exergy, the net rate of entropy change, and the specific output power were calculated as 18.2\%, 21.3\%, 172.97 kW/K, and 31.43 kJ/kg, respectively. The cost of drilling a well, as well as designing and construction of Damavand’s geothermal power plant, were calculated to be 4.2 and 521.5 million (USD), respectively. Also, the cost per generation of each kW/h of power in Damavand power plant was 17 cents. The estimated payback time is calculated as 15 years. The analysis of the cycle in different months of the year showed that exergy efficiency has little change.

The Dynamic Capabilities Framework is distinguished from other “textbook” strategic methodologies and is applied to today’s upstream strategic context and inflection point. Dynamic capabilities join with strategy to empower an organization’s ability to integrate, build and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing markets. Dynamic capabilities differ from ordinary capabilities in that they orchestrate clusters of ordinary capabilities, best practices and competencies to gain competitive and performance advantages – capturing opportunities and managing strategic risks. Three dynamic capabilities are described that have particular importance for upstream oil and gas companies in the new business environment: (1) ambidexterity across mature and emerging domains; (2) the ability to manage the upstream business ecosystem; and (3) the ability to manage Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (HSSE) considerations in the multinational corporation and throughout the business ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Geologic structure plays an important role in controlling fluid flow in geothermal systems. In particular, very complex structural settings, consisting of many closely spaced and intersecting faults, host many geothermal systems. To elucidate the key geologic factors that affect fault-controlled geothermal circulation, it is critical to precisely characterize the structural and stratigraphic geometries in these complex settings. Here, we present a methodology and the results of 3D geologic analyses of two geothermal systems in the Basin and Range, USA. This methodology is a quantitative and geologically focused technique that can be used to precisely characterize geothermal areas, in a time when future geothermal growth demands increased exploration precision and efficiency. Surficial and subsurface geologic and geophysical data are synthesized in the construction of detailed 3D geologic maps of geothermal areas. Based on these 3D geologic maps, we examine several geologic attributes that control permeability development and geothermal fluid flow along faults. We use the stress state of faults and the distribution of structural discontinuities (i.e., fault intersections and fault terminations) to identify locations of upflow along faults in these geothermal systems. These results and the methodology presented herein are directly applicable to structurally controlled geothermal fields in the Basin and Range and worldwide. As development focus shifts toward blind geothermal resources, integration of precisely characterized subsurface structural information into exploration methods will be increasingly critical to continued growth in geothermal exploration and development.},

	abstract = {The performance of a design team is influenced by each team member’s unique cognitive style – i.e., their preferred manner of managing structure as they solve problems, make decisions, and seek to bring about change. Cognitive style plays an important role in how teams of engineers design and collaborate, but the interactions of cognitive style with team organization and processes have not been well studied. The limitations of small-scale behavioral experiments have led researchers to develop computational models for simulating teamwork; however, none have modeled the effects of individuals’ cognitive styles. This paper presents the Kirton Adaption–Innovation Inventory agent-based organizational optimization model (KABOOM), the first agent-based model of teamwork to incorporate cognitive style. In KABOOM, heterogeneous agents imitate the diverse problem-solving styles described by the Kirton Adaption-Innovation construct, which places each individual somewhere along the spectrum of cognitive style preference. Using the model, we investigate the interacting effects of a team’s communication patterns, specialization, and cognitive style composition on design performance. By simulating cognitive style in the context of team problem solving, KABOOM lays the groundwork for the development of team simulations that reflect humans’ diverse problem-solving styles.},

The primary method applied in assessments of identified geothermal systems by the USGS and other organizations is the volume method, in which the recoverable heat is estimated from the thermal energy available in a reservoir. An important focus in the assessment project is on the development of geothermal resource models consistent with the production histories and observed characteristics of exploited geothermal fields. The new assessment will incorporate some changes in the models for temperature and depth ranges for electric power production, preferred chemical geothermometers for estimates of reservoir temperatures, estimates of reservoir volumes, and geothermal energy recovery factors. Monte Carlo simulations are used to characterize uncertainties in the estimates of electric power generation. These new models for the recovery of heat from heterogeneous, fractured reservoirs provide a physically realistic basis for evaluating the production potential of natural geothermal reservoirs.},

This paper highlights serious problems in this classic approach for dealing with skewed data. Despite the common belief that the log transformation can decrease the variability of data and make data conform more closely to the normal distribution, this is usually not the case. Moreover, the results of standard statistical tests performed on log-transformed data are often not relevant for the original, non-transformed data.We demonstrate these problems by presenting examples that use simulated data. We conclude that if used at all, data transformations must be applied very cautiously. We recommend that in most circumstances researchers abandon these traditional methods of dealing with skewed data and, instead, use newer analytic methods that are not dependent on the distribution the data, such as generalized estimating equations (GEE).},

It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},

	abstract = {The number of heat flow measurements at the Earth surface has significantly increased since the last global analysis (Pollack et al., 1993, https://doi.org/10.1029/93RG01249), and the most recent of them provide insights into key locations. This paper presents a new compilation, which includes approximately 70,000 measurements. Continental heat flow (67 mWm−2) does not change significantly, but the differences are more important for oceanic heat flow. The divergence with conductive cooling models is reduced significantly for young ages of the seafloor, since the most recent measurements (92 mWm−2) are significantly higher on average than the older ones (79 mWm−2). This is related to a better quality and a better sampling of measurements in regions affected by hydrothermal circulation. The total Earth heat loss derived from these most recent measurements is estimated to ∼40–42 TW and represents only 3–5 TW less than with a conductive cooling model (∼45–47 TW). Hydrothermal heat loss in the oceanic domain is estimated with a new method based on the ruggedness of the seafloor and represents ∼1.5 TW more than previous estimates. The heat flow variability on continents is so large that defining a trend with stratigraphic or tectono-thermal age is difficult and makes extrapolation from age a poor predictor. On the other hand, additional geological and geophysical information can be combined with age for better predictions. A generalized similarity method was used here to predict heat flow on a global 0.5° × 0.5° grid. The agreement with local measurements is generally good and increases with the number and quality of proxies.},

This Global Strain Rate Model (GSRM v.2.1) is a vast improvement over its predecessor both in terms of amount of data input as in an increase in spatial model resolution by factor of ∼2.5 in areas with dense data coverage. We determined 6739 velocities from time series of (mostly) continuous GPS measurements; i.e., by far the largest global velocity solution to date. We transformed 15,772 velocities from 233 (mostly) published studies onto our core solution to obtain 22,511 velocities in the same reference frame. Care is taken to not use velocities from stations (or time periods) that are affected by transient phenomena; i.e., this data set consists of velocities best representing the interseismic plate velocity. About 14\% of the Earth is allowed to deform in 145,086 deforming grid cells (0.25° longitude by 0.2° latitude in dimension). The remainder of the Earth's surface is modeled as rigid spherical caps representing 50 tectonic plates. For 36 plates we present new GPS-derived angular velocities. For all the plates that can be compared with the most recent geologic plate motion model, we find that the difference in angular velocity is significant. The rigid-body rotations are used as boundary conditions in the strain rate calculations. The strain rate field is modeled using the Haines and Holt method, which uses splines to obtain an self-consistent interpolated velocity gradient tensor field, from which strain rates, vorticity rates, and expected velocities are derived. We also present expected faulting orientations in areas with significant vorticity, and update the no-net rotation reference frame associated with our global velocity gradient field. Finally, we present a global map of recurrence times for Mw=7.5 characteristic earthquakes.},

	abstract = {Since they are two of the prominent continental rifts which are active today, the Kenya and Rio Grande rifts have been the subject of many recent studies. There are many gaps in our knowledge, but the data available make a comparative analysis worthwhile. Although they are part of much larger extensional regimes, these rifts are of similar dimensions and extent. In addition to these obvious similarities, geophysical data suggest the crustal and upper mantle structures of these features are also similar. They both are associated with relatively localized crustal thinning and much broader zones of lithospheric thinning. Seismic and gravity data indicate that the basement structure beneath both rift valleys is very complex, and recent studies have stressed the role of low-angle normal faulting in their structural development. However, geologic data and earthquake focal mechanisms indicate that high-angle normal faults and strike-slip faulting are also important. However, as one looks at the tectonic evolution and volcanic histories of the rifts, many differences are apparent. Volcanism has been virtually continuous in the Kenya rift area for over 20 Ma and the total volume of extrusives is over 200,000 km3. Unlike the Kenya rift, the Rio Grande rift formed in a region which was already both tectonically and magmatically active. Thus, there is uncertainty about what constitutes rift volcanism in the Rio Grande rift. However, the volume of extrusives generally accepted to be associated with this rift is about 5–10\% that of the Kenya rift. The compositions of the volcanics are also very different in these rifts, and the Kenya rift displays migration of volcanic activity, and compositional variations in time which have not been recognized in the Rio Grande rift. The volcanic activity in the Rio Grande rift post-dated most of the faulting, whereas faulting and volcanism display complex interactions in Kenya. The nature and timing of uplift are important but difficult questions in both rifts.},

For this 6-yr period 198 earthquakes with magnitudes of 2.0 or greater were located. An unusual feature of the seismicity 1999 through 2004 is that 63\% of the earthquakes were concentrated in two swarms, one near water disposal wells on the western edge of the Dagger Draw oil field in southeastern New Mexico, and the other within and bordering the coalbed methane fields of the Raton Basin in northeastern New Mexico. We suggest that the proximity of these swarms to oil and gas fields may indicate that the earthquakes are induced by destabilization of the crust through production and waste disposal practices. The remaining 37\% of the earthquakes 1999 through 2004 were concentrated near Socorro and west Texas. Except for the Socorro area, activity along the Rio Grande rift was low.},

	abstract = {Geophysical inversion and machine learning both provide solutions for inverse problems in which we estimate model parameters from observations. Geophysical inversions such as impedance inversion, amplitude-variation-with-offset inversion, and traveltime tomography are commonly used in the industry to yield physical properties from measured seismic data. Machine learning, a data-driven approach, has become popular during the past decades and is useful for solving such inverse problems. An advantage of machine learning methods is that they can be implemented without knowledge of physical equations or theories. The challenges of machine learning lie in acquiring enough training data and selecting relevant parameters, which are essential in obtaining a good quality model. In this study, we compare geophysical inversion and machine learning approaches in solving inverse problems and show similarities and differences of these approaches in a mathematical form and numerical tests. Both methods aid in solving ill-posed and nonlinear problems and use similar optimization techniques. We take reflectivity inversion as an example of the inverse problem. We apply geophysical inversion based on the least-squares method and artificial neural networks as a machine learning approach to solve reflectivity inversion using 2D synthetic data sets and 3D field data sets. A neural network with multiple hidden layers successfully generates the nonlinear mapping function to predict reflectivity. For this inverse problem, we test different L1 regularizers for both approaches. L1 regularization alleviates effects of noise in seismic traces and enhances sparsity, especially in the least-squares method. The 2D synthetic wedge model and field data examples show that neural networks yield high spatial resolution.},

Using large-scale optimization methods, parallel forward solvers and a flexible implementation in terms of model parametrization allows us to investigate different coupling approaches for the various physical parameters involved in the joint inversion. Here we compare two different coupling approaches, direct parameter coupling where we calculate conductivities and densities from seismic slownesses and cross-gradient coupling, where each model cell has an independent value for each physical property and a structural similarity is enforced through a term in the objective function.For both types of approaches we see an improvement of the inversion results over single inversions when the inverted data sets are generated from compatible models. As expected the direct coupling approach results in a stronger interaction between the data sets and in this case better results compared to the cross-gradient coupling. In contrast, when the inverted MT data is generated from a model that violates the parameter relationship in some regions but conforms with the cross-gradient assumptions, we obtain good results with the cross-gradient approach, while the direct coupling approach results in spurious features. This makes the cross-gradient approach the first choice for regions were a direct relationship between the physical parameters is unclear.},

The Hengill volcanic triple-junction complex has a well-developed geothermal system, which is being exploited to extract hot fluids that are used for electrical power and heat production. In the framework of the I-GET project, a 4-month temporary seismological network including seven high-dynamic broadband instruments was deployed and 1D transient electromagnetic soundings (TEM) and 3D magnetotelluric (MT) surveys were performed to improve the understanding of the relationships between structural features, seismic activity and fluid production at the Hengill geothermal system. The MT and TEM data set are analysed elsewhere. The analysis of the seismological data set allowed the detection and classification of more than 600 earthquakes, among which long-period (LP) earthquakes were observed for the first time in this area. This work focuses first on a joint inversion for the 3D velocity structure and determination of the locations of the hypocentres from about 250 local volcano-tectonic earthquakes with clear P- and S-wave arrival times. The results confirm those from earlier tomography studies in this area. Integrating the seismic velocity and resistivity models in a semi-quantitative approach by cross-plotting the resistivity model with the velocity ratio VP/VS delineates a structural body with a high seismic velocity ratio and low resistivity that is interpreted as the main heat source of the geothermal system.},

	abstract = {The vast supply of geothermal energy stored throughout the Earth and the exceedingly long time required to dissipate that energy makes the world’s geothermal energy supply nearly limitless. As such, this resource holds the potential to provide a large supply of the world’s energy demands; however, like all natural resources, it must be utilized in an appropriate manner if it is to be sustainable. Understanding sustainable use of geothermal resources requires thorough characterization efforts aimed at better understanding subsurface properties. The goal of this work is to understand which critical subsurface properties exert the most influence on sustainable geothermal production as a means to provide targeted future resource characterization strategies. Borehole temperature and reservoir pressure data were analyzed to estimate reservoir thermal and hydraulic properties at an active geothermal site. These reservoir properties then served as inputs for an analytical model which simulated net power production over a 30-year period. The analytical model was used to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters were most critical in constraining the sustainability of a geothermal reservoir. Modeling results reveal that the number of preferential flow pathways (i.e. fractures) used for heat transport provides the greatest impact on geothermal reservoir sustainability. These results suggest that early and preproduction geothermal reservoir exploration would achieve the greatest benefit from characterization strategies which seek to delineate the number of active flow pathways present in the system.},

	abstract = {A recent experimental evaluation assessed 19 time series classification (TSC) algorithms and found that one was significantly more accurate than all others: the Flat Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (Flat-COTE). Flat-COTE is an ensemble that combines 35 classifiers over four data representations. However, while comprehensive, the evaluation did not consider deep learning approaches. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have seen a surge in popularity and are now state of the art in many fields and raises the question of whether CNNs could be equally transformative for TSC. We implement a benchmark CNN for TSC using a common structure and use results from a TSC-specific CNN from the literature. We compare both to Flat-COTE and find that the collective is significantly more accurate than both CNNs. These results are impressive, but Flat-COTE is not without deficiencies. We significantly improve the collective by proposing a new hierarchical structure with probabilistic voting, defining and including two novel ensemble classifiers built in existing feature spaces, and adding further modules to represent two additional transformation domains. The resulting classifier, the Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE), encapsulates classifiers built on five data representations. We demonstrate that HIVE-COTE is significantly more accurate than Flat-COTE (and all other TSC algorithms that we are aware of) over 100 resamples of 85 TSC problems and is the new state of the art for TSC. Further analysis is included through the introduction and evaluation of 3 new case studies and extensive experimentation on 1,000 simulated datasets of 5 different types.},

Our Bag-of-SFA-Symbols (BOSS) model combines the extraction of substructures with the tolerance to extraneous and erroneous data using a noise reducing representation of the time series.

The proposed algorithm combines established feature extraction methods

allows to start on a problem with only limited domain knowledge
available, can be trivially parallelized, is highly scalable and based
on well studied non-parametric hypothesis tests. We benchmark our

	abstract = {Uncertainty is inherent in every stage of the oil and gas exploration and production (E\&P) business and understanding uncertainty enables mitigation of E\&P risks. Therefore, quantification of uncertainty is beneficial for decision making and uncertainty should be managed along with other aspects of business. For example, decisions on well positioning should take into account the structural uncertainty related to the non-uniqueness of a velocity model used to create a seismic depth image. Moreover, recent advances in seismic acquisition technology, such as full-azimuth, long-offset techniques, combined with high-accuracy migration algorithms such as reverse-time migration, can greatly enhance images even in highly complex structural settings, provided that an Earth velocity model with sufficient resolution is available. Modern practices often use non-seismic observation to better constrain velocity model building. However, even with additional information, there is still ambiguity in our velocity models caused by the inherent non-uniqueness of the seismic experiment. Many different Earth velocity models exist that match the observed seismic (and well) data and this ambiguity grows rapidly away from well controls. The result is uncertainty in the seismic velocity model and the true positions of events in our images. Tracking these uncertainties can lead to significant improvement in the quantification of exploration risk (e.g., trap failure when well-logging data are not representative), drilling risk (e.g., dry wells and abnormal pore pressure) and volumetric uncertainties. Whilst the underlying ambiguity can never be fully eradicated, a quantified measure of these uncertainties provides a valuable tool for understanding and evaluating the risks and for development of better risk-mitigation plans and decision-making strategies.},

	abstract = {Exploration and Production (E\&amp;P) business faces uncertainty of our knowledge about the Earth at all stages of the aggregated workflow. Every stage uses ambiguous input and generates ambiguous output that becomes input to the next stage. Thus, understanding, quantifying and tracking uncertainty across stages and disciplines are essential for the ultimate uncertainty that impacts decision-making. In particular, the structural uncertainty is derived from the model uncertainty as a result of seismic depth imaging. Whilst the underlying ambiguity can never be fully eradicated, a quantified measure of these uncertainties provides deeper understanding of the risks and leads to more informed decision making. In the past decade, with the advancement of sensor and computer technology, the seismic industry has made great improvements in data-acquisition designs as well as depth-imaging and model-building algorithms. However, the cost/benefit justification for the value of information (VoI) obtained by utilization of these technologies remains mainly qualitative. The same limitation applies to geoscience knowledge. This paper discusses how uncertainty analysis can lead to quantifying VoI and also how application of probabilistic assessment of our geoscience knowledge can lead to investment decision-making based on probabilistic appraisal. We demonstrate that uncertainty is a good metric for the value of knowledge and serves also as a unifying language for translating, transmitting, and enhancing knowledge as one E\&amp;P stage transitions to another and as one discipline communicates with another. The paper discusses a stochastic technique of this translation through evaluation of different appraisal parameters (gross rock volume, original oil in place, net primary production) as an extended application of seismicbased imaging and structural uncertainty derived from velocity model building.},

Prior research indicates that auditors can negotiate adjustments individually (a sequential strategy) or can negotiate multiple adjustments within the same negotiation setting (a simultaneous strategy). This paper examines the relative effectiveness of a simultaneous versus sequential negotiation strategy in eliciting concessions from clients and engendering greater client satisfaction. Participants negotiated audit adjustments with a simulated auditor who employed one of the two negotiation strategies. We find evidence that a simultaneous strategy elicits significantly greater total concessions from client managers and also generates more positive attitudes toward the auditor. We also manipulate the magnitude of the issues negotiated and find that significantly greater concessions are offered when larger issues are presented first. These findings have important implications for auditors, as they suggest that negotiating issues simultaneously and presenting larger issues first can result in significantly improved negotiation outcomes.},

	abstract = {Scholars who study negotiation increasingly recognize the importance of social context, seeing negotiations not merely as 1-shot interactions but as influenced by what came before. Under this longitudinal conceptualization of negotiation, a number of recent studies demonstrate that social psychological outcomes from prior negotiations are positively related to economic performance in subsequent negotiations when negotiating repeatedly with the same counterpart. In this report, we investigate a counterexample in the context of “sequential negotiations,” which we define as multiple negotiation sessions that occur within a short time frame but facing different counterparts in each session. We theorize, in sequential negotiations, that subjective value from 1 negotiation should be negatively related to objective outcomes in a subsequent negotiation because of spillover effects of incidental anger and pride. We test this model in 2 studies: a multiround lab study with a student sample and a longitudinal field study with employees negotiating as part of their jobs. Results from both studies support the hypothesized negative relationship between subjective value from an initial negotiation and the objective outcome from a subsequent negotiation with a different counterpart. The mediating role of pride is supported partially in Study 1 and fully in Study 2, whereas the mediating role of anger is not supported in either study. We discuss implications for negotiation theory and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

Among the various kinds of microwave tubes, gyrotrons are the most well known devices which used for amplification and generation of energy at high power levels especially for ECRH which has become a well established heating method for both Tokamaks and Stellarators. The gyrotron operates by transfer of energy from an electron beam to an RF wave, but a fast wave, using relativity, which can reach high frequencies, and working with inhomogeneous fields. The electron gun, immersed in a strong magnetic field, allows to obtaining an electron beam of high density and because these electrons are bunched in phase due to relativistic effects, the radiation is coherent. The wave is generated in a specially designed interaction cavity (resonator) which can sustain oscillations on the desired frequency. In this case we can obtain waves of high frequencies and high powers. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Axial morphology along the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR) systematically changes from an axial high to a deep rift valley at a nearly uniform intermediate spreading rate between 100°-116°E, west of the Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD). Basalt geochemistry has a consistent Indian-mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) type isotopic signature, so changes in axial topography are attributed to variations in both mantle temperature and melt supply. Wide-angle seismic refraction lines were shot to four ocean bottom hydrophones within SEIR segments P1, P2, S1, and T, where each segment is characterized by a different morphology. We constructed 2-D crustal velocity models by jointly inverting hand-picked P wave refraction (Pg) and Moho reflection (PmP) traveltime data using a top-down, minimum-structure methodology. The results show a 1.5 km eastward decrease in crustal thickness across the study area, with segment averages ranging from 6.1 km at P1 to 4.6 km at T. Melt generation models require a ̃30°C decrease in mantle temperature toward the AAD to account for the crustal thickness trend. Significant changes in axial morphology accompany small-scale variations in crustal thickness, consistent with models of crustal accretion where ridge topography is determined by a balance between mantle temperature, melt supply, and cooling from hydrothermal circulation. Layer 3 thins by 3.0 km as layer 2 thickens by 1.4 km between segments P1 and T, reflecting the eastward decrease in melt supply and increase in melt lens depth. The trade-off in seismic layers may be explained by models relating the increase in overburden pressure on a deepening melt lens to the volume of magma erupted into the upper crust rather than cooling at depth to form new lower crustal material. © 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Several complex models require unique mantle conditions to explain the Australian Antarctic Discordance (AAD), an unusually deep and rugged section of the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR) between ∼120°–128°E. Seismic evidence suggests the AAD is instead the manifestation of two contrasting mantle domains converging along its eastern edge. Variations in axial morphology and flanking topographic relief along the SEIR arise as ridge segments to the west (Indian mantle) grade into a cooler melting regime while those to the east (Pacific mantle) are more magmatically robust. Seismic refraction data show crustal thickness decreases from the west into the AAD at a rate of 0.1 km/100 km, then rapidly increases from 4.8 ± 0.4 km to 7.3 ± 0.2 km across the eastern border. The AAD thus appears to be the terminal end of a long-wavelength reduction in melt supply at what may be the simplest global example of a mantle boundary.},

Compressional wave traveltime data collected by 10 ocean bottom seismometers indicate that the median crustal thickness is ∼6.2 km and increases to ∼8.2 km beneath the Sojourn Ridge. The conspicuous absence of crustal thinning beneath both the Sojourn and Hotu-Matua ridge systems is strong support against a boudinage-style model for the formation of these volcanic complexes. Our results suggest the ridge loads are partially supported by both plate flexure and underplating, with an additional mantle component inferred from the analysis of gravity data, Rayleigh wave tomography, and teleseismic body wave delays. Small-scale convection could produce the observed crustal thickness pattern but fails to explain the geochemical and formation age trends along the ridges. We prefer a model where the channelized flow of low-density material in the upper mantle, possibly undergoing small-scale convection, is advected toward the ridge crest. Lows in the gravity field reflect the density contrast within the asthenosphere, and decompression melting amid upwelling limbs of the convective cells sustains the development of the associated ridge systems.

We analyze, in detail, the nonuniqueness associated with unknown origin time, which we argue is often a more important source of nonuniqueness than is unknown location. While this type of nonuniqueness has long been understood to be a problem in teleseimic tomography, we show here that it is of equal importance in all coupled problems. We provide a practical method for calculating null solutions and calculate them for several commonly encountered experimental geometries.

	volume = {179},
	doi = {10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04300.x},
	abstract = {Axial and ridge flank depths on the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR) systematically increase for 2500 km from 90°E to 120°E approaching the Australian-Antarctic Discordance. The SEIR also experiences an abrupt change in ridge axis morphology near 103°30′E with axial highs found to the west and axial valleys to the east. Since the spreading rate is constant throughout this region, these variations have been ascribed to an along-axis gradient in mantle temperature. A seismic refraction experiment provides information on the crustal thickness and seismic velocity structure of two segments with differing axial morphology. Segment P2, centred near 102°E with an axial high has a mean crustal thickness of 5.9 ± 0.2 km, while the mean crustal thickness is 5.3 ± 0.3 km at Segment S1 with an axial valley and centred near 109°45′E. Isostatic compensation of the difference in crustal thickness and density structure between the two segments only accounts for 33 m of the 198 m difference in average ridge flank depth between the two segments. The remaining depth difference must result from a difference in mantle density. Melt production models imply a mantle temperature difference of 11-13.5 °C to produce the observed difference in crustal thickness. Isostatic compensation of the two segments requires that the resulting density difference must extend to about 300 km in the mantle.The transition in axial morphology along the SEIR is very abrupt occurring over a narrow zone within a single segment in which the transition is complete. If a linear mantle temperature gradient is assumed, the temperature difference across the transition segment is only 2.4 °C. The change in axial morphology is accompanied by abrupt changes in other parameters including abyssal hill height, magnetic anomaly amplitude, layer 2a thickness and the presence or absence of an axial magma lens. The abrupt, coincident change in a number of parameters with a very small change in mantle temperature strongly suggests a threshold change between two distinctly different modes of crustal accretion. The trigger for the transition appears to be whether a steady-state crustal magma lens can be maintained. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 RAS.},

In late spring 2003 an acoustic calibration study was conducted in the northern Gulf of Mexico to obtain broad frequency band measurements of seismic sources used by the R/V Maurice Ewing. Received levels in deep water were lower than anticipated based on modeling, and in shallow water they were higher. For the marine mammals of greatest concern (beaked whales) the 1-20 kHz frequency range is considered particularly significant [National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and U. S. Navy, 2001; Frantzis et al., 2002]. 1/3-octave measurements show received levels at 1 kHz are ∼20-33 dB (re: 1 μPa) lower than peak levels at 5-100 Hz, and decrease an additional ∼20-33 dB in the 10-20 kHz range.

	abstract = {A dual 137 GHz heterodyne radiometer system was used to study grooved nuclear grade graphite (SGL Group NBG17) inside an electric furnace from room temperature to 1250°C. The millimeter wave radiometer views were collinear with the electric field of one polarized parallel, and the other perpendicular, to the grooves. The anisotropic emissivity was readily detected for 100 µm wide grooves of various depths with a spacing period of 0.76 mm. The emissivity in the 500-1250°C temperature range was found to be 5.1 ± 0.5\% when the E-field was parallel to the grooves and a factor of 2-4 higher, depending on groove depth, in the perpendicular direction. The parallel surface emissivity which was identical to ungrooved surface emissivity corresponded to a 137 GHz surface resistance of 5.3 Ohms, which is about 2.5 times higher than the value predicted from frequency scaling dc surface resistance. The perpendicular emissivity had a modulation with groove depth at odd integral multiples of ¼ λ, predicted by electromagnetic finite difference time domain analysis.},

To eliminate drill string vibrations, such as stick-slip, and achieve better control of drill bit rotating motion, an IARC controller was designed to compensate nonlinear friction torque directly and address system uncertainties during drilling. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed IARC controller.},

	abstract = {The two most costly drilling problems are stuck pipes and circulation losses. This chapter addresses circulation loss. This can occur at any time during a drilling operation, is very common in depleted reservoirs, and must be cured before drilling can resume. If water-based drilling fluids are in use, the problem can often be reduced by pumping Lost Circulation Materials (LCM) into the wellbore. Mud companies have many techniques to stop mud losses, which basically all use particles in various combinations as bridging materials. This chapter provides a detailed insight into the interpretation of leak-off tests at the onset of the fracture initiation. Research indicates that two main characteristics of a filter cake can give a high fracture pressure. The model presented here applies to a typical drilling operation, using particle laden drilling muds with filtrate control, performing leak-off tests with a large annular volume, and relative small fractures opening during the tests. It suggests that increased intra-particle friction may help reduce circulation losses with oil-based drilling fluids. One way to do this is to increase angularity of the mud particles.},
