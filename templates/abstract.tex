%Geothermal provides a continuous, low greenhouse-gas emissions source of energy with enormous potential in the United States, both singularly or as part of a renewable energy portfolio. Although a small contributor to the current national energy grid, geothermal capture for generating electricity dates back nearly a century for natural hydrothermal systems. More recently, technologies at various readiness levels give the promise of geothermal access using enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), which provide engineered solutions for subsurface fluid circulation to tap into thermal reservoirs in a wider variety of locations. Nevertheless, the risk of high costs associated with exploration and production remain a hurdle to broader adoption of geothermal as part of a diverse commercial energy mix.

%In this thesis, risk-mitigation strategies for geothermal exploration and production target two separate aspects of the system lifecycle. The first considers how data collected for interrelated earth systems can indicate geothermal potential at the play and prospect scale. Analytical workflows integrating geologic and geophysical data are used to estimate the subsurface geothermal gradient, with quantitative uncertainty estimates associated with the data inputs, the modeling approach, and the size of the solution space. These uncertainty estimates provide a measure of risk, as well as decision tools for investments in additional data-gathering activities before the first well is drilled. The second focus looks at flexibility in engineering design with real options for expanding an existing power facility with geothermal. Specifically, key uncertainties are defined and integrated into a cost-modeling approach that uses decision rules to define an ensemble of possible outcomes. Tailoring the model and decision rules to the potential field and location of interest allows for a rapid but thorough test of project feasibility and the selection of build-out alternatives that limit downside risk and capture upside potential. In total, the learnings from these investigations provide insights into how geothermal can be a commercially viable, low-carbon option as energy companies navigate the ongoing energy transition.
Geothermal provides a continuous, low-emissions source of energy with enormous potential in the United States, both singularly or as part of a broader energy mix. Although a small contributor to the current national energy grid, geothermal electricity generation dates back nearly a century for natural hydrothermal systems. More recently, enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) promise a broader reach with engineered solutions for extracting subsurface heat from a wider variety of locations. The potential synergy between the oil \& gas and geothermal offers an opportunity for building a lower-carbon energy portfolio that requires compatible skills and expertise. Nevertheless, the risks involved at multiple stages of the geothermal field lifecycle remain a hurdle to adoption of geothermal.

In this thesis, risk-mitigation strategies for geothermal target two phases of the lifecycle: exploration and production. The first strategy uses a diverse set of measurements spanning multiple interrelated earth systems to collectively determine geothermal potential at the play scale. Analytical workflows integrate geologic and geophysical data to estimate subsurface geothermal gradient, with quantitative uncertainty estimates associated with the measurements, the models, and the solution space. These uncertainty estimates provide a measure of risk, as well as decision tools for investments in additional data-gathering activities before the first well is drilled. The second strategy applies flexibility in engineering design to a hypothetical EGS expansion of an existing power facility. Specifically, key uncertainties are integrated into a cost model with operational decision rules to create an ensemble of possible outcomes. Tailoring the model and decision rules to a particular facility concept allows for a rapid feasibility testing and optimization of project actions that limit downside risk while capturing upside potential. Both of these strategies use uncertainty characterization to reduce the threat of high-consequence geothermal risks. And by including them in a broader risk management approach, oil \& gas companies can make data-driven decisions on investing in geothermal during the energy transition.
