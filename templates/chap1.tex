\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch1:intro}
The pursuit of energy has shaped the history of mankind from its very beginning. And while the image of ancient humans huddled around fires for warmth, protection, and meal preparation is an archetype of our ancestral past, modern human needs remain much the same. Lighting to extend day into night, heating and cooling for residential comfort, cooking of the food we eat, access to the advanced technologies of our time --- these all require energy from one source or another. Choices abound, from animal and plant-based fuels, to buried hydrocarbon resources, to alternatives like solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, and geothermal. The balance and utilization of these resources can shape societal growth on the geopolitical stage and influence the very future of the habitable Earth.

This thesis examines risk-mitigation strategies to help advance the role of one source, geothermal, in addressing ever-growing energy needs in a viable way. This chapter reflects on the extent of those needs and the conditions that may uniquely support an increased focus on geothermal as part of a commercial energy portfolio in the near-term. Opportunities and challenges associated with geothermal also lay the foundation for research questions motivating the remainder of this body of work.

\section{Energy Trends}\label{ch1:trends}
The \acrlong{eia} (\acrshort{eia}) publishes annual forecasts on U.S.\ energy generation and consumption in the \acrlong{aeo} (\acrshort{aeo}) report. Based on the 2020 reference case, the AEO model predicts a 70\% increase in U.S.\ energy usage by 2050, driven primarily by the industrial and power sectors \citep{eia_annual_2021}. Electricity generation also grows by a third, largely due to renewables and natural gas as coal, nuclear, and oil experience reductions (Figure \ref{fig:eia_2021_projections}). These predictions are offered with the caveat of greater uncertainty in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, although the EIA suggests a return to normal will occur by 2025 and broader, decadal trends will remain unchanged \citep{eia_annual_2021}. International forecasts show similar growth in consumption and production, but traditional sources of energy like coal and natural gas also increase in capacity to meet the needs of India, China, and other rapidly developing nations \citep{eia_international_2020}.

Lazard Asset Management breaks renewables down by \acrlong{lcoe} (\acrshort{lcoe}) in U.S.\ dollars/MWh, where \acrshort{lcoe} is the estimated lifetime average net cost per unit energy of an electricity-generating plant. In their 2020 analysis, intermittent energy sources like wind and utility-scale solar are already cost-competitive with fossil fuel-derived sources (Figure \ref{fig:lazard_lcoe}) \citep{lazard_lazards_2020}. Geothermal, an “always on” source of power, ranges from \$59-\$101/MWh LCOE, making it second-tier in cost-competitiveness but comparable to community and rooftop solar installations \citep{lazard_lazards_2020}. Overall, the transition away from fossil fuel super-dominance is in progress, and the demand for energy in support of population growth and country development will remain an industry driver over the next 30 years.

\section{Upstream Commercial Pressures}\label{ch1:upstream}
Businesses focused on exploration and production of oil \& gas face a growing list of pressures influencing future corporate strategy. On one hand, the increase in energy consumption predicted by the AEO and IEO supports a steady increase in production to meet global demand; however, geopolitical tensions, state-ownership of oil companies, and breakthrough technologies create a volatile landscape unforgiving of an unsophisticated production approach. In just the past 15 years, major downturns in oil prices were triggered by a mixture of factors: the financial crisis, tied to banking practices and housing market instability in 2008 \citep{singh_2007-2008_2021}; increased production from U.S.\ unconventional plays and supply decisions from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2014 \citep{lioudis_what_2021}; and a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia coinciding with a global pandemic in 2020 \citep{blessing_what_2021}. Additional uncertainty comes from National Oil Companies (NOCs) that control the majority of the world’s petroleum reserves, production, and rights for exploration and development. NOCs operate under different business drivers than International Oil Companies (IOCs), with ramifications on the stability of IOC investments and access to reserves as seen in Russia and Venezuela  \citep{bremmer_long_2010,pirog_role_2007}. Meanwhile, disruptive technologies like precise directional drilling and efficient hydraulic fracturing have freed access to previously cost-prohibitive reserves, changing the balance of power as countries like the U.S.\ and China become less reliant on foreign hydrocarbon imports \citep{shuen_dynamic_2014}.

Layered on top of these macroeconomic influences are unexpected events that have enormous impact on energy production and distribution operations. The 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 acted as an accelerator on longer-term trends of digital transformation and decarbonization in the oil \& gas industry. In the wake of a 25\% decrease in global demand, companies responded with massive layoffs and restructuring, a heightened focus on digitalization, and portfolio rationalizations that include shale write-downs and asset divestments \citep{deloitte_2021_2020}. Also, extreme weather events are shining a critical spotlight on how energy is managed now and in the future. Blackouts, water outages, and surge pricing on electricity impacted millions of Texans in February 2021 when a winter storm brought record cold temperatures, exposing systematic weaknesses in energy infrastructure and generator preparedness for low-probability but feasible working conditions \citep{harc_winter_2021,lazard_lazards_2020}. And additional threats loom in the cyberworld as malicious hacking activities have rippling social and financial implications. One such attack on Colonial Pipeline, which handles almost 50\% of the liquid fuels supplied to the U.S.\ East Coast, led to gasoline shortages, price spikes, chemical factory shut-downs, and worldwide news coverage until the nearly \$5 million in ransom was paid in May 2021 \citep{sanger_pipeline_2021}.

\section{Net Zero Ambitions}\label{ch1:netzero}
The 2015 Paris climate agreement set a target of $<2^\circ$C on the rise in global temperatures above the pre-industrial average (i.e., the period from 1850-1900) to prevent the most extreme impacts of climate change \citep{unfccc_paris_2015}. The more commonly-ascribed $1.5^\circ$C target may be unachievable given current trajectories, and international calls to action are focusing on reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions to ``net zero'' as quickly as possible \citep{ipcc_global_2018}. Greater public awareness and alignment with these targets puts pressure on the energy industry to revise their traditional business models. Beginning in 2020, top-tier oil and gas companies started issuing press releases outlining energy transition targets for 2025, 2030, 2050, and beyond \citep{bp_international_2020,chevron_chevron_2021,conocophillips_conocophillips_2020,equinor_equinor_2020,exxonmobil_exxonmobil_2021,shell_responsible_2020,shell_shell_2021,total_total_2020,total_2020_2021}. The proposed strategies vary but generally focus on (i) reducing company stake in fossil-fuel exploration and production activities, (ii) setting a net zero target applicable to emissions from operations, product carbon intensity, and carbon offsets, and (iii) dedicating investments in low- and no-carbon energy alternatives to replace hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, pressure to do more, faster reached a new peak in May 2021 when a court decision in The Netherlands and shareholder votes for two U.S.\ majors demanded an accelerated push toward emissions reductions and low-carbon energy options \citep{mcwilliams_investors_2021}.

\section{Geothermal Energy}\label{ch1:geothermal}
Several factors must be met for an energy source to be considered a viable and sustainable alternative to the carbon-based fuels (coal, natural gas, oil) that currently meet much of the world’s energy needs. \citeauthor{glassley_geothermal_2015} outlines a succinct set of criteria for such an energy resource: i) self-replenishment, ii) adequate abundance to meet energy demands, iii) low- to no-greenhouse gas emissions, and iv) cost competitiveness compared to accessible alternatives (\citeyear[p.\ 7]{glassley_geothermal_2015}). The first criterion precisely characterizes renewable sources of energy like solar, gravitational, and geothermal. Solar energy includes both direct (sunlight) and indirect (wind, waves, water cycle) resources \citep{hohmeyer_ipcc_2008}. Gravitational energy drives the tides and supports energy-storage solutions like pumped-storage hydropower \citep{eere_pumped-storage_2021,hohmeyer_ipcc_2008}. And geothermal energy is primarily derived from the natural decay of radioactive isotopes within the Earth \citep{hohmeyer_ipcc_2008}. Table \ref{tab:renewableflux} specifically addresses criterion ii; the annual abundances of most renewable sources exceed energy demand, with geothermal scaling several orders of magnitude greater in annual flux/demand than other options \citep{hohmeyer_ipcc_2008}. Geothermal also meets the third criterion by providing a no-carbon source of energy that could support net zero aspirations when used in place of fossil fuels. The fourth criterion is less clear-cut. Geothermal costs depend strictly on use case, but as noted in Section \ref{ch1:trends}, LCOE analysis currently ranks geothermal below wind and solar in the list of renewable options \citep{lazard_lazards_2020}. Does this make geothermal non-viable as an alternative? Perhaps no, as geothermal comes with several unique opportunities and benefits.

Most fundamentally, geothermal energy offers a reliable, nearly inexhaustible resource accessible anywhere around the world. Unlike wind and solar, which depend on favorable locations and vary with both season and time of day, geothermal is ubiquitous and continuous. Furthermore, it can provide baseload power for regional electrical grids without the additional need of assistive energy-storage technology \citep{tester_future_2006}. Based on history, one might assume geothermal only works under conventional hydrothermal conditions, e.g., near active volcanoes (e.g., Iceland, Indonesia) or within major rift zones (e.g., East African Rift). However, additional opportunities lie in low-temperature direct-use geothermal for heating and cooling of buildings, industrial processing, agricultural activities, and manufacturing \citep[p.\ 9]{glassley_geothermal_2015}. And technology supporting Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) provides access to subsurface heat in areas without hydrothermal conditions \citep{tester_future_2006}. Natural radioactive decay takes place throughout the Earth’s crust, contributing to the global rise in temperature with depth known as the geothermal gradient \citep[p.\ 279]{fowler_solid_2005}. Where conditions permit access to suitable depths, there is the potential for geothermal energy capture.

For all its benefits, the use of geothermal energy comes with a set of challenges that are unique among renewable energy options. Many mirror issues faced by oil \& gas producers, like failures in drilling equipment or borehole integrity. Others include risk of low resource quality, poor reservoir productivity, unexpected structural and stratigraphic complexity, and undesirable fluid chemistry \citep{beckers_low-temperature_2016, hadi_resource_2010}. The similarities extend into unconventionals/EGS, where hydrofracturing risks comprise inadequate permeable rock volume within the stimulated fracture zone, short-circuiting of fluid flow between injection and productions wells, fluid losses within the subsurface, and induced seismic activity \citep{jelacic_evaluation_2008,pan_establishment_2019}. As in oil \& gas projects, some of these risks can be mitigated through appropriate subsurface characterization, others from high-resolution reservoir and fracture modeling. Collectively, the overlap in operational challenges and the skill sets required to tackle them defines a unique compatibility between oil \& gas and geothermal. Knowledge transfer between the two domains could directly benefit geothermal operations and risk-mitigation strategies \citep{petty_synergies_2009}. And investing in geothermal assets could take upstream companies a step closer to meeting net zero commitments while retaining and utilizing existing talent.

One of the most significant uncertainties for geothermal is cost. The scope of an LCOE assessment considers all costs in a geothermal project, from early exploration, through development drilling and power plant construction, to operations and maintenance over a 25- to 30-year lifetime \citep{beckers_introducing_2013, entingh_volume_2006, tester_economic_1990}. Studies show drilling of exploration, appraisal, injection, and production wells can account for 60-75\% of the total EGS project expenses \citep{lukawski_uncertainty_2016, petty_synergies_2009}. New technologies being developed may help address future drilling costs \citep{lowry_geovision_2017,nrel_2020_2020}. However, substantial project savings could also be achieved through better characterization prior to drilling the first exploration well; increasing the probability of well success without multi-million dollar well failures would certainly reduce LCOE. In addition, choices in the design of the geothermal power plant may also have significant cost implications over the life of a geothermal field. Lessons can be learned from power plants built to design specifications incompatible with actual production conditions \citep[e.g.,][]{manente_hybrid_2011}. Improving the economics of geothermal start with recognizing uncertainties in the system and using those uncertainties to make better decisions on \textit{where to drill} and \textit{how to produce}. Providing the appropriate tools and methods to make these decisions could also help oil \& gas companies manage the risk of embracing lower-carbon energy production with geothermal as part of their energy mix.

\section{Research Questions}\label{ch1:researchqs}
Based on the above-mentioned opportunity to define methods that incorporate uncertainty characterization for risk management in geothermal exploration and production, this thesis will address the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Can geothermal exploration risk be mitigated by insights derived from readily-available data sources with little change in project cost? Can the data establish additional actions for further risk reduction before drilling a geothermal well? 
  \item How can characterization of present and future uncertainties influence the development strategy for geothermal facilities? In what ways will such an approach mitigate risk, if at all?
\end{enumerate}
